</br>Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Speak, speak.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Resolved. resolved.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>We know't, we know't.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
</br>Is't a verdict?
</br>
</br>All:
</br>No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>One word, good citizens.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
</br>What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
</br>would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
</br>wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
</br>but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
</br>afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
</br>inventory to particularise their abundance; our
</br>sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
</br>our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
</br>speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Consider you what services he has done for his country?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Very well; and could be content to give him good
</br>report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Nay, but speak not maliciously.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
</br>it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
</br>content to say it was for his country he did it to
</br>please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
</br>is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
</br>vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
</br>he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
</br>What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
</br>is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Come, come.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Soft! who comes here?
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
</br>the people.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
</br>With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
</br>had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
</br>which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
</br>suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
</br>have strong arms too.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
</br>Will you undo yourselves?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I tell you, friends, most charitable care
</br>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
</br>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
</br>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
</br>Against the Roman state, whose course will on
</br>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
</br>Of more strong link asunder than can ever
</br>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
</br>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
</br>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
</br>You are transported by calamity
</br>Thither where more attends you, and you slander
</br>The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
</br>When you curse them as enemies.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
</br>yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
</br>crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
</br>support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
</br>established against the rich, and provide more
</br>piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
</br>the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
</br>there's all the love they bear us.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Either you must
</br>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
</br>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
</br>A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
</br>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
</br>To stale 't a little more.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
</br>fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
</br>you, deliver.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>There was a time when all the body's members
</br>Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
</br>That only like a gulf it did remain
</br>I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
</br>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
</br>Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
</br>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
</br>And, mutually participate, did minister
</br>Unto the appetite and affection common
</br>Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
</br>Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
</br>For, look you, I may make the belly smile
</br>As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
</br>To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
</br>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
</br>As you malign our senators for that
</br>They are not such as you.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Your belly's answer? What!
</br>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
</br>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
</br>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
</br>With other muniments and petty helps
</br>In this our fabric, if that they--
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>What then?
</br>'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
</br>Who is the sink o' the body,--
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Well, what then?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>The former agents, if they did complain,
</br>What could the belly answer?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I will tell you
</br>If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
</br>Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Ye're long about it.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Note me this, good friend;
</br>Your most grave belly was deliberate,
</br>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
</br>'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
</br>'That I receive the general food at first,
</br>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
</br>Because I am the store-house and the shop
</br>Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
</br>I send it through the rivers of your blood,
</br>Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
</br>And, through the cranks and offices of man,
</br>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
</br>From me receive that natural competency
</br>Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
</br>You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Ay, sir; well, well.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>'Though all at once cannot
</br>See what I do deliver out to each,
</br>Yet I can make my audit up, that all
</br>From me do back receive the flour of all,
</br>And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>It was an answer: how apply you this?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>The senators of Rome are this good belly,
</br>And you the mutinous members; for examine
</br>Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
</br>Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
</br>No public benefit which you receive
</br>But it proceeds or comes from them to you
</br>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
</br>You, the great toe of this assembly?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>I the great toe! why the great toe?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
</br>Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
</br>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
</br>Lead'st first to win some vantage.
</br>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
</br>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
</br>The one side must have bale.
</br>Hail, noble Marcius!
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
</br>That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
</br>Make yourselves scabs?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>We have ever your good word.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>He that will give good words to thee will flatter
</br>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
</br>That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
</br>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
</br>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
</br>Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
</br>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
</br>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
</br>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
</br>And curse that justice did it.
</br>Who deserves greatness
</br>Deserves your hate; and your affections are
</br>A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
</br>Which would increase his evil. He that depends
</br>Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
</br>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
</br>With every minute you do change a mind,
</br>And call him noble that was now your hate,
</br>Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
</br>That in these several places of the city
</br>You cry against the noble senate, who,
</br>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
</br>Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
</br>The city is well stored.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Hang 'em! They say!
</br>They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
</br>What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
</br>Who thrives and who declines; side factions
</br>and give out
</br>Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
</br>And feebling such as stand not in their liking
</br>Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
</br>grain enough!
</br>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
</br>And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
</br>With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
</br>As I could pick my lance.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
</br>For though abundantly they lack discretion,
</br>Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
</br>What says the other troop?
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>They are dissolved: hang 'em!
</br>They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
</br>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
</br>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
</br>Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
</br>They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
</br>And a petition granted them, a strange one--
</br>To break the heart of generosity,
</br>And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
</br>As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
</br>Shouting their emulation.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>What is granted them?
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
</br>Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
</br>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
</br>The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
</br>Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
</br>Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
</br>For insurrection's arguing.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>This is strange.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Go, get you home, you fragments!
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Where's Caius Marcius?
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Here: what's the matter?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
</br>Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
</br>The Volsces are in arms.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>They have a leader,
</br>Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
</br>I sin in envying his nobility,
</br>And were I any thing but what I am,
</br>I would wish me only he.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>You have fought together.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
</br>Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
</br>Only my wars with him: he is a lion
</br>That I am proud to hunt.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Then, worthy Marcius,
</br>Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>It is your former promise.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Sir, it is;
</br>And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
</br>Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
</br>What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
</br>
</br>TITUS:
</br>No, Caius Marcius;
</br>I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
</br>Ere stay behind this business.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>O, true-bred!
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
</br>Our greatest friends attend us.
</br>
</br>TITUS:
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Noble Marcius!
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Nay, let them follow:
</br>The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
</br>To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
</br>Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>He has no equal.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Nay. but his taunts.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Be-mock the modest moon.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>The present wars devour him: he is grown
</br>Too proud to be so valiant.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Such a nature,
</br>Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
</br>Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
</br>His insolence can brook to be commanded
</br>Under Cominius.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Fame, at the which he aims,
</br>In whom already he's well graced, can not
</br>Better be held nor more attain'd than by
</br>A place below the first: for what miscarries
</br>Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
</br>To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
</br>Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
</br>Had borne the business!'
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Besides, if things go well,
</br>Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
</br>Of his demerits rob Cominius.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Come:
</br>Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
</br>Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
</br>To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
</br>In aught he merit not.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Let's hence, and hear
</br>How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
</br>More than his singularity, he goes
</br>Upon this present action.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Lets along.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
</br>That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
</br>And know how we proceed.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Is it not yours?
</br>What ever have been thought on in this state,
</br>That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
</br>Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
</br>Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
</br>I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
</br>'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
</br>Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
</br>The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
</br>Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
</br>Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
</br>And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
</br>These three lead on this preparation
</br>Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
</br>Consider of it.'
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Our army's in the field
</br>We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
</br>To answer us.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Nor did you think it folly
</br>To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
</br>They needs must show themselves; which
</br>in the hatching,
</br>It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
</br>We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
</br>To take in many towns ere almost Rome
</br>Should know we were afoot.
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>Noble Aufidius,
</br>Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
</br>Let us alone to guard Corioli:
</br>If they set down before 's, for the remove
</br>Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
</br>They've not prepared for us.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>O, doubt not that;
</br>I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
</br>Some parcels of their power are forth already,
</br>And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
</br>If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
</br>'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
</br>Till one can do no more.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>The gods assist you!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>And keep your honours safe!
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Farewell.
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>Farewell.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Farewell.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
</br>more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
</br>should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
</br>won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
</br>he would show most love. When yet he was but
</br>tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
</br>youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
</br>for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
</br>sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
</br>how honour would become such a person. that it was
</br>no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
</br>renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
</br>danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
</br>war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
</br>bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
</br>more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
</br>than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
</br>man.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Then his good report should have been my son; I
</br>therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
</br>sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
</br>alike and none less dear than thine and my good
</br>Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
</br>country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
</br>
</br>Gentlewoman:
</br>Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Indeed, you shall not.
</br>Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
</br>See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
</br>As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
</br>Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
</br>'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
</br>Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
</br>With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
</br>Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
</br>Or all or lose his hire.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
</br>Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
</br>When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
</br>Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
</br>At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
</br>We are fit to bid her welcome.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
</br>And tread upon his neck.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>My ladies both, good day to you.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Sweet madam.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>I am glad to see your ladyship.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
</br>What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
</br>faith. How does your little son?
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
</br>look upon his school-master.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
</br>very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
</br>Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
</br>confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
</br>butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
</br>again; and after it again; and over and over he
</br>comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
</br>fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
</br>teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
</br>it!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>One on 's father's moods.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>A crack, madam.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
</br>the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>Not out of doors!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>She shall, she shall.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
</br>threshold till my lord return from the wars.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
</br>you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
</br>my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Why, I pray you?
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
</br>the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
</br>Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
</br>were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
</br>pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
</br>excellent news of your husband.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>O, good madam, there can be none yet.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
</br>him last night.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>Indeed, madam?
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
</br>Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
</br>whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
</br>our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
</br>down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
</br>prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
</br>on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
</br>thing hereafter.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
</br>disease our better mirth.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
</br>Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
</br>solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
</br>you much mirth.
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>Well, then, farewell.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>My horse to yours, no.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>'Tis done.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>Agreed.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Say, has our general met the enemy?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>So, the good horse is mine.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>I'll buy him of you.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
</br>For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>How far off lie these armies?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Within this mile and half.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
</br>Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
</br>That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
</br>To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
</br>Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
</br>That's lesser than a little.
</br>Hark! our drums
</br>Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
</br>Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
</br>Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
</br>They'll open of themselves.
</br>Hark you. far off!
</br>There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
</br>Amongst your cloven army.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>O, they are at it!
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
</br>Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
</br>With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
</br>brave Titus:
</br>They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
</br>Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
</br>He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
</br>And he shall feel mine edge.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>All the contagion of the south light on you,
</br>You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
</br>Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
</br>Further than seen and one infect another
</br>Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
</br>That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
</br>From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
</br>All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
</br>With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
</br>Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
</br>And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
</br>If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
</br>As they us to our trenches followed.
</br>So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
</br>'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
</br>Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
</br>
</br>First Soldier:
</br>Fool-hardiness; not I.
</br>
</br>Second Soldier:
</br>Nor I.
</br>
</br>First Soldier:
</br>See, they have shut him in.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>To the pot, I warrant him.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>What is become of Marcius?
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Slain, sir, doubtless.
</br>
</br>First Soldier:
</br>Following the fliers at the very heels,
</br>With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
</br>Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
</br>To answer all the city.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>O noble fellow!
</br>Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
</br>And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
</br>A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
</br>Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
</br>Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
</br>Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
</br>The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
</br>Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
</br>Were feverous and did tremble.
</br>
</br>First Soldier:
</br>Look, sir.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>O,'tis Marcius!
</br>Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
</br>
</br>First Roman:
</br>This will I carry to Rome.
</br>
</br>Second Roman:
</br>And I this.
</br>
</br>Third Roman:
</br>A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>See here these movers that do prize their hours
</br>At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
</br>Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
</br>Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
</br>Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
</br>And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
</br>There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
</br>Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
</br>Convenient numbers to make good the city;
</br>Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
</br>To help Cominius.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
</br>Thy exercise hath been too violent for
</br>A second course of fight.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Sir, praise me not;
</br>My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
</br>The blood I drop is rather physical
</br>Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
</br>I will appear, and fight.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
</br>Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
</br>Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
</br>Prosperity be thy page!
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Thy friend no less
</br>Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>Thou worthiest Marcius!
</br>Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
</br>Call thither all the officers o' the town,
</br>Where they shall know our mind: away!
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
</br>we are come off
</br>Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
</br>Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
</br>We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
</br>By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
</br>The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
</br>Lead their successes as we wish our own,
</br>That both our powers, with smiling
</br>fronts encountering,
</br>May give you thankful sacrifice.
</br>Thy news?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>The citizens of Corioli have issued,
</br>And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
</br>I saw our party to their trenches driven,
</br>And then I came away.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Though thou speak'st truth,
</br>Methinks thou speak'st not well.
</br>How long is't since?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Above an hour, my lord.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
</br>How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
</br>And bring thy news so late?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Spies of the Volsces
</br>Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
</br>Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
</br>Half an hour since brought my report.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Who's yonder,
</br>That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
</br>He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
</br>Before-time seen him thus.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
</br>More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
</br>From every meaner man.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Come I too late?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
</br>But mantled in your own.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>O, let me clip ye
</br>In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
</br>As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
</br>And tapers burn'd to bedward!
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Flower of warriors,
</br>How is it with Titus Lartius?
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>As with a man busied about decrees:
</br>Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
</br>Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
</br>Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
</br>Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
</br>To let him slip at will.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Where is that slave
</br>Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
</br>Where is he? call him hither.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Let him alone;
</br>He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
</br>The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
</br>The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
</br>From rascals worse than they.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>But how prevail'd you?
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
</br>Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
</br>If not, why cease you till you are so?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Marcius,
</br>We have at disadvantage fought and did
</br>Retire to win our purpose.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>How lies their battle? know you on which side
</br>They have placed their men of trust?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>As I guess, Marcius,
</br>Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
</br>Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
</br>Their very heart of hope.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>I do beseech you,
</br>By all the battles wherein we have fought,
</br>By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
</br>We have made to endure friends, that you directly
</br>Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
</br>And that you not delay the present, but,
</br>Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
</br>We prove this very hour.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Though I could wish
</br>You were conducted to a gentle bath
</br>And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
</br>Deny your asking: take your choice of those
</br>That best can aid your action.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Those are they
</br>That most are willing. If any such be here--
</br>As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
</br>Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
</br>Lesser his person than an ill report;
</br>If any think brave death outweighs bad life
</br>And that his country's dearer than himself;
</br>Let him alone, or so many so minded,
</br>Wave thus, to express his disposition,
</br>And follow Marcius.
</br>O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
</br>If these shows be not outward, which of you
</br>But is four Volsces? none of you but is
</br>Able to bear against the great Aufidius
</br>A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
</br>Though thanks to all, must I select
</br>from all: the rest
</br>Shall bear the business in some other fight,
</br>As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
</br>And four shall quickly draw out my command,
</br>Which men are best inclined.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>March on, my fellows:
</br>Make good this ostentation, and you shall
</br>Divide in all with us.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
</br>As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
</br>Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
</br>For a short holding: if we lose the field,
</br>We cannot keep the town.
</br>
</br>Lieutenant:
</br>Fear not our care, sir.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
</br>Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
</br>Worse than a promise-breaker.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>We hate alike:
</br>Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
</br>More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Let the first budger die the other's slave,
</br>And the gods doom him after!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>If I fly, Marcius,
</br>Holloa me like a hare.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Within these three hours, Tullus,
</br>Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
</br>And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
</br>Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
</br>Wrench up thy power to the highest.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Wert thou the Hector
</br>That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
</br>Thou shouldst not scape me here.
</br>Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
</br>In your condemned seconds.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
</br>Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
</br>Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
</br>Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
</br>I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
</br>And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
</br>dull tribunes,
</br>That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
</br>Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
</br>Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
</br>Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
</br>Having fully dined before.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>O general,
</br>Here is the steed, we the caparison:
</br>Hadst thou beheld--
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>Pray now, no more: my mother,
</br>Who has a charter to extol her blood,
</br>When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
</br>As you have done; that's what I can; induced
</br>As you have been; that's for my country:
</br>He that has but effected his good will
</br>Hath overta'en mine act.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>You shall not be
</br>The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
</br>The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
</br>Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
</br>To hide your doings; and to silence that,
</br>Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
</br>Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
</br>In sign of what you are, not to reward
</br>What you have done--before our army hear me.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
</br>To hear themselves remember'd.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Should they not,
</br>Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
</br>And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
</br>Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
</br>The treasure in this field achieved and city,
</br>We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
</br>Before the common distribution, at
</br>Your only choice.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>I thank you, general;
</br>But cannot make my heart consent to take
</br>A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
</br>And stand upon my common part with those
</br>That have beheld the doing.
</br>
</br>MARCIUS:
</br>May these same instruments, which you profane,
</br>Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
</br>I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
</br>Made all of false-faced soothing!
</br>When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
</br>Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
</br>No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
</br>My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
</br>Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
</br>You shout me forth
</br>In acclamations hyperbolical;
</br>As if I loved my little should be dieted
</br>In praises sauced with lies.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Too modest are you;
</br>More cruel to your good report than grateful
</br>To us that give you truly: by your patience,
</br>If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
</br>Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
</br>Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
</br>As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
</br>Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
</br>My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
</br>With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
</br>For what he did before Corioli, call him,
</br>With all the applause and clamour of the host,
</br>CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
</br>The addition nobly ever!
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I will go wash;
</br>And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
</br>Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
</br>I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
</br>To undercrest your good addition
</br>To the fairness of my power.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>So, to our tent;
</br>Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
</br>To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
</br>Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
</br>The best, with whom we may articulate,
</br>For their own good and ours.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>I shall, my lord.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
</br>Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
</br>Of my lord general.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I sometime lay here in Corioli
</br>At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
</br>He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
</br>But then Aufidius was within my view,
</br>And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
</br>To give my poor host freedom.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>O, well begg'd!
</br>Were he the butcher of my son, he should
</br>Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>Marcius, his name?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>By Jupiter! forgot.
</br>I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
</br>Have we no wine here?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Go we to our tent:
</br>The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
</br>It should be look'd to: come.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>The town is ta'en!
</br>
</br>First Soldier:
</br>'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Condition!
</br>I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
</br>Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
</br>What good condition can a treaty find
</br>I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
</br>I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
</br>And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
</br>As often as we eat. By the elements,
</br>If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
</br>He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
</br>Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
</br>I thought to crush him in an equal force,
</br>True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
</br>Or wrath or craft may get him.
</br>
</br>First Soldier:
</br>He's the devil.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
</br>With only suffering stain by him; for him
</br>Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
</br>Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
</br>The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
</br>Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
</br>Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
</br>My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
</br>At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
</br>Against the hospitable canon, would I
</br>Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
</br>Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
</br>Be hostages for Rome.
</br>
</br>First Soldier:
</br>Will not you go?
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
</br>'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
</br>How the world goes, that to the pace of it
</br>I may spur on my journey.
</br>
</br>First Soldier:
</br>I shall, sir.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Good or bad?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
</br>love not Marcius.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Pray you, who does the wolf love?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>The lamb.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
</br>noble Marcius.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
</br>are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
</br>
</br>Both:
</br>Well, sir.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
</br>have not in abundance?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Especially in pride.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>And topping all others in boasting.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>This is strange now: do you two know how you are
</br>censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
</br>right-hand file? do you?
</br>
</br>Both:
</br>Why, how are we censured?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
</br>
</br>Both:
</br>Well, well, sir, well.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
</br>occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
</br>give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
</br>your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
</br>pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
</br>being proud?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>We do it not alone, sir.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
</br>are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
</br>single: your abilities are too infant-like for
</br>doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
</br>could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
</br>and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
</br>O that you could!
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>What then, sir?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
</br>proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
</br>any in Rome.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Menenius, you are known well enough too.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
</br>loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
</br>Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
</br>favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
</br>upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
</br>with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
</br>of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
</br>malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
</br>you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
</br>you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
</br>crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
</br>delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
</br>compound with the major part of your syllables: and
</br>though I must be content to bear with those that say
</br>you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
</br>tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
</br>the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
</br>well enough too? what barm can your bisson
</br>conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
</br>known well enough too?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
</br>are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
</br>wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
</br>cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
</br>and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
</br>second day of audience. When you are hearing a
</br>matter between party and party, if you chance to be
</br>pinched with the colic, you make faces like
</br>mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
</br>patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
</br>dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
</br>by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
</br>cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
</br>a pair of strange ones.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Come, come, you are well understood to be a
</br>perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
</br>bencher in the Capitol.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
</br>encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
</br>you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
</br>wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
</br>so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
</br>cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
</br>saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
</br>who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
</br>since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
</br>best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
</br>your worships: more of your conversation would
</br>infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
</br>plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
</br>How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
</br>were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
</br>your eyes so fast?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
</br>the love of Juno, let's go.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Ha! Marcius coming home!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
</br>approbation.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
</br>Marcius coming home!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Nay,'tis true.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
</br>another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
</br>at home for you.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
</br>me!
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
</br>years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
</br>the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
</br>Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
</br>of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
</br>not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>O, no, no, no.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
</br>victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
</br>with the oaken garland.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
</br>Aufidius got off.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
</br>an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
</br>fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
</br>that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
</br>has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
</br>son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
</br>action outdone his former deeds doubly
</br>
</br>VALERIA:
</br>In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
</br>true purchasing.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>The gods grant them true!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>True! pow, wow.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>True! I'll be sworn they are true.
</br>Where is he wounded?
</br>God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
</br>home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
</br>large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
</br>stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
</br>Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
</br>nine that I know.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
</br>wounds upon him.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
</br>Hark! the trumpets.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
</br>carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
</br>Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
</br>Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
</br>
</br>Herald:
</br>Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
</br>Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
</br>With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
</br>In honour follows Coriolanus.
</br>Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>No more of this; it does offend my heart:
</br>Pray now, no more.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Look, sir, your mother!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>O,
</br>You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
</br>For my prosperity!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Nay, my good soldier, up;
</br>My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
</br>By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
</br>What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
</br>But O, thy wife!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>My gracious silence, hail!
</br>Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
</br>That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
</br>Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
</br>And mothers that lack sons.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Now, the gods crown thee!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>And live you yet?
</br>O my sweet lady, pardon.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
</br>And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
</br>And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
</br>A curse begin at very root on's heart,
</br>That is not glad to see thee! You are three
</br>That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
</br>We have some old crab-trees here
</br>at home that will not
</br>Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
</br>We call a nettle but a nettle and
</br>The faults of fools but folly.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Ever right.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Menenius ever, ever.
</br>
</br>Herald:
</br>Give way there, and go on!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>I have lived
</br>To see inherited my very wishes
</br>And the buildings of my fancy: only
</br>There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
</br>Our Rome will cast upon thee.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Know, good mother,
</br>I had rather be their servant in my way,
</br>Than sway with them in theirs.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>On, to the Capitol!
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
</br>Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
</br>Into a rapture lets her baby cry
</br>While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
</br>Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
</br>Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
</br>Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
</br>With variable complexions, all agreeing
</br>In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
</br>Do press among the popular throngs and puff
</br>To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
</br>Commit the war of white and damask in
</br>Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
</br>Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
</br>As if that whatsoever god who leads him
</br>Were slily crept into his human powers
</br>And gave him graceful posture.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>On the sudden,
</br>I warrant him consul.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Then our office may,
</br>During his power, go sleep.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>He cannot temperately transport his honours
</br>From where he should begin and end, but will
</br>Lose those he hath won.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>In that there's comfort.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Doubt not
</br>The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
</br>Upon their ancient malice will forget
</br>With the least cause these his new honours, which
</br>That he will give them make I as little question
</br>As he is proud to do't.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>I heard him swear,
</br>Were he to stand for consul, never would he
</br>Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
</br>The napless vesture of humility;
</br>Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
</br>To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>'Tis right.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
</br>Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
</br>And the desire of the nobles.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>I wish no better
</br>Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
</br>In execution.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>'Tis most like he will.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>It shall be to him then as our good wills,
</br>A sure destruction.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>So it must fall out
</br>To him or our authorities. For an end,
</br>We must suggest the people in what hatred
</br>He still hath held them; that to's power he would
</br>Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
</br>Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
</br>In human action and capacity,
</br>Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
</br>Than camels in the war, who have their provand
</br>Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
</br>For sinking under them.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>This, as you say, suggested
</br>At some time when his soaring insolence
</br>Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
</br>If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
</br>As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
</br>To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
</br>Shall darken him for ever.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>What's the matter?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
</br>That Marcius shall be consul:
</br>I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
</br>The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
</br>Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
</br>Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
</br>As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
</br>A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
</br>I never saw the like.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Let's to the Capitol;
</br>And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
</br>But hearts for the event.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Have with you.
</br>
</br>First Officer:
</br>Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
</br>for consulships?
</br>
</br>Second Officer:
</br>Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
</br>Coriolanus will carry it.
</br>
</br>First Officer:
</br>That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
</br>loves not the common people.
</br>
</br>Second Officer:
</br>Faith, there had been many great men that have
</br>flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
</br>be many that they have loved, they know not
</br>wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
</br>they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
</br>Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
</br>him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
</br>disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
</br>them plainly see't.
</br>
</br>First Officer:
</br>If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
</br>he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
</br>good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
</br>devotion than can render it him; and leaves
</br>nothing undone that may fully discover him their
</br>opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
</br>displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
</br>dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
</br>
</br>Second Officer:
</br>He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
</br>ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
</br>having been supple and courteous to the people,
</br>bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
</br>an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
</br>planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
</br>in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
</br>silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
</br>ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
</br>malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
</br>reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
</br>
</br>First Officer:
</br>No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
</br>are coming.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Having determined of the Volsces and
</br>To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
</br>As the main point of this our after-meeting,
</br>To gratify his noble service that
</br>Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
</br>please you,
</br>Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
</br>The present consul, and last general
</br>In our well-found successes, to report
</br>A little of that worthy work perform'd
</br>By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
</br>We met here both to thank and to remember
</br>With honours like himself.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Speak, good Cominius:
</br>Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
</br>Rather our state's defective for requital
</br>Than we to stretch it out.
</br>Masters o' the people,
</br>We do request your kindest ears, and after,
</br>Your loving motion toward the common body,
</br>To yield what passes here.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>We are convented
</br>Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
</br>Inclinable to honour and advance
</br>The theme of our assembly.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Which the rather
</br>We shall be blest to do, if he remember
</br>A kinder value of the people than
</br>He hath hereto prized them at.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>That's off, that's off;
</br>I would you rather had been silent. Please you
</br>To hear Cominius speak?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Most willingly;
</br>But yet my caution was more pertinent
</br>Than the rebuke you give it.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>He loves your people
</br>But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
</br>Worthy Cominius, speak.
</br>Nay, keep your place.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
</br>What you have nobly done.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Your horror's pardon:
</br>I had rather have my wounds to heal again
</br>Than hear say how I got them.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Sir, I hope
</br>My words disbench'd you not.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>No, sir: yet oft,
</br>When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
</br>You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
</br>your people,
</br>I love them as they weigh.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Pray now, sit down.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
</br>When the alarum were struck than idly sit
</br>To hear my nothings monster'd.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Masters of the people,
</br>Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
</br>That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
</br>He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
</br>Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
</br>Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
</br>That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
</br>Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
</br>The man I speak of cannot in the world
</br>Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
</br>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
</br>Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
</br>Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
</br>When with his Amazonian chin he drove
</br>The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
</br>An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
</br>Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
</br>And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
</br>When he might act the woman in the scene,
</br>He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
</br>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
</br>Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
</br>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
</br>He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
</br>Before and in Corioli, let me say,
</br>I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
</br>And by his rare example made the coward
</br>Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
</br>A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
</br>And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
</br>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
</br>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
</br>Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
</br>The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
</br>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
</br>And with a sudden reinforcement struck
</br>Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
</br>When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
</br>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
</br>Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
</br>And to the battle came he; where he did
</br>Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
</br>'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
</br>Both field and city ours, he never stood
</br>To ease his breast with panting.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Worthy man!
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>He cannot but with measure fit the honours
</br>Which we devise him.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Our spoils he kick'd at,
</br>And look'd upon things precious as they were
</br>The common muck of the world: he covets less
</br>Than misery itself would give; rewards
</br>His deeds with doing them, and is content
</br>To spend the time to end it.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>He's right noble:
</br>Let him be call'd for.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Call Coriolanus.
</br>
</br>Officer:
</br>He doth appear.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
</br>To make thee consul.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I do owe them still
</br>My life and services.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>It then remains
</br>That you do speak to the people.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I do beseech you,
</br>Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
</br>Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
</br>For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
</br>That I may pass this doing.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Sir, the people
</br>Must have their voices; neither will they bate
</br>One jot of ceremony.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Put them not to't:
</br>Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
</br>Take to you, as your predecessors have,
</br>Your honour with your form.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>It is apart
</br>That I shall blush in acting, and might well
</br>Be taken from the people.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Mark you that?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
</br>Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
</br>As if I had received them for the hire
</br>Of their breath only!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Do not stand upon't.
</br>We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
</br>Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
</br>Wish we all joy and honour.
</br>
</br>Senators:
</br>To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>You see how he intends to use the people.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
</br>As if he did contemn what he requested
</br>Should be in them to give.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Come, we'll inform them
</br>Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
</br>I know, they do attend us.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>We may, sir, if we will.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
</br>power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
</br>his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
</br>tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
</br>he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
</br>our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
</br>monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
</br>were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
</br>which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
</br>monstrous members.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>And to make us no better thought of, a little help
</br>will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
</br>himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>We have been called so of many; not that our heads
</br>are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
</br>but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
</br>truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
</br>one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
</br>and their consent of one direct way should be at
</br>once to all the points o' the compass.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
</br>fly?
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
</br>will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
</br>if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Why that way?
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
</br>melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
</br>for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
</br>that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
</br>say, if he would incline to the people, there was
</br>never a worthier man.
</br>Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
</br>behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
</br>come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
</br>by threes. He's to make his requests by
</br>particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
</br>honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
</br>tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
</br>you shall go by him.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Content, content.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>O sir, you are not right: have you not known
</br>The worthiest men have done't?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>What must I say?
</br>'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
</br>My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
</br>I got them in my country's service, when
</br>Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
</br>From the noise of our own drums.'
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>O me, the gods!
</br>You must not speak of that: you must desire them
</br>To think upon you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Think upon me! hang 'em!
</br>I would they would forget me, like the virtues
</br>Which our divines lose by 'em.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>You'll mar all:
</br>I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
</br>In wholesome manner.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Bid them wash their faces
</br>And keep their teeth clean.
</br>So, here comes a brace.
</br>You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Mine own desert.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Your own desert!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Ay, but not mine own desire.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>How not your own desire?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
</br>poor with begging.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
</br>gain by you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>The price is to ask it kindly.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
</br>show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
</br>good voice, sir; what say you?
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
</br>begged. I have your alms: adieu.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>But this is something odd.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
</br>voices that I may be consul, I have here the
</br>customary gown.
</br>
</br>Fourth Citizen:
</br>You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
</br>have not deserved nobly.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Your enigma?
</br>
</br>Fourth Citizen:
</br>You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
</br>been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
</br>the common people.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>You should account me the more virtuous that I have
</br>not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
</br>sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
</br>estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
</br>gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
</br>rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
</br>the insinuating nod and be off to them most
</br>counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
</br>bewitchment of some popular man and give it
</br>bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
</br>I may be consul.
</br>
</br>Fifth Citizen:
</br>We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
</br>you our voices heartily.
</br>
</br>Fourth Citizen:
</br>You have received many wounds for your country.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
</br>will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
</br>
</br>Both Citizens:
</br>The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Most sweet voices!
</br>Better it is to die, better to starve,
</br>Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
</br>Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
</br>To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
</br>Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
</br>What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
</br>The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
</br>And mountainous error be too highly heapt
</br>For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
</br>Let the high office and the honour go
</br>To one that would do thus. I am half through;
</br>The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
</br>Here come more voices.
</br>Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
</br>Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
</br>Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
</br>I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
</br>Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
</br>Indeed I would be consul.
</br>
</br>Sixth Citizen:
</br>He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
</br>man's voice.
</br>
</br>Seventh Citizen:
</br>Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
</br>and make him good friend to the people!
</br>
</br>All Citizens:
</br>Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Worthy voices!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
</br>Endue you with the people's voice: remains
</br>That, in the official marks invested, you
</br>Anon do meet the senate.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Is this done?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>The custom of request you have discharged:
</br>The people do admit you, and are summon'd
</br>To meet anon, upon your approbation.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Where? at the senate-house?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>There, Coriolanus.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>May I change these garments?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>You may, sir.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
</br>Repair to the senate-house.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I'll keep you company. Will you along?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>We stay here for the people.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Fare you well.
</br>He has it now, and by his looks methink
</br>'Tis warm at 's heart.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
</br>will you dismiss the people?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>He has our voices, sir.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
</br>He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Certainly
</br>He flouted us downright.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
</br>He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
</br>His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Why, so he did, I am sure.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>No, no; no man saw 'em.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>He said he had wounds, which he could show
</br>in private;
</br>And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
</br>'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
</br>But by your voices, will not so permit me;
</br>Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
</br>Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
</br>Your most sweet voices: now you have left
</br>your voices,
</br>I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Why either were you ignorant to see't,
</br>Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
</br>To yield your voices?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Could you not have told him
</br>As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
</br>But was a petty servant to the state,
</br>He was your enemy, ever spake against
</br>Your liberties and the charters that you bear
</br>I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
</br>A place of potency and sway o' the state,
</br>If he should still malignantly remain
</br>Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
</br>Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
</br>That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
</br>Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
</br>Would think upon you for your voices and
</br>Translate his malice towards you into love,
</br>Standing your friendly lord.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Thus to have said,
</br>As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
</br>And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
</br>Either his gracious promise, which you might,
</br>As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
</br>Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
</br>Which easily endures not article
</br>Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
</br>You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
</br>And pass'd him unelected.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Did you perceive
</br>He did solicit you in free contempt
</br>When he did need your loves, and do you think
</br>That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
</br>When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
</br>No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
</br>Against the rectorship of judgment?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Have you
</br>Ere now denied the asker? and now again
</br>Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
</br>Your sued-for tongues?
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>And will deny him:
</br>I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
</br>They have chose a consul that will from them take
</br>Their liberties; make them of no more voice
</br>Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
</br>As therefore kept to do so.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Let them assemble,
</br>And on a safer judgment all revoke
</br>Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
</br>And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
</br>With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
</br>How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
</br>Thinking upon his services, took from you
</br>The apprehension of his present portance,
</br>Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
</br>After the inveterate hate he bears you.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Lay
</br>A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
</br>No impediment between, but that you must
</br>Cast your election on him.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Say, you chose him
</br>More after our commandment than as guided
</br>By your own true affections, and that your minds,
</br>Preoccupied with what you rather must do
</br>Than what you should, made you against the grain
</br>To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
</br>How youngly he began to serve his country,
</br>How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
</br>The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
</br>That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
</br>Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
</br>Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
</br>That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
</br>And
</br>Twice being
</br>Was his great ancestor.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>One thus descended,
</br>That hath beside well in his person wrought
</br>To be set high in place, we did commend
</br>To your remembrances: but you have found,
</br>Scaling his present bearing with his past,
</br>That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
</br>Your sudden approbation.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Say, you ne'er had done't--
</br>Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
</br>And presently, when you have drawn your number,
</br>Repair to the Capitol.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>We will so: almost all
</br>Repent in their election.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Let them go on;
</br>This mutiny were better put in hazard,
</br>Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
</br>If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
</br>With their refusal, both observe and answer
</br>The vantage of his anger.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>To the Capitol, come:
</br>We will be there before the stream o' the people;
</br>And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
</br>Which we have goaded onward.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
</br>Our swifter composition.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
</br>Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
</br>Upon's again.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>They are worn, lord consul, so,
</br>That we shall hardly in our ages see
</br>Their banners wave again.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Saw you Aufidius?
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
</br>Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
</br>Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Spoke he of me?
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>He did, my lord.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>How? what?
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>How often he had met you, sword to sword;
</br>That of all things upon the earth he hated
</br>Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
</br>To hopeless restitution, so he might
</br>Be call'd your vanquisher.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>At Antium lives he?
</br>
</br>LARTIUS:
</br>At Antium.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
</br>To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
</br>Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
</br>The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
</br>For they do prank them in authority,
</br>Against all noble sufferance.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Pass no further.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Ha! what is that?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>What makes this change?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>The matter?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Cominius, no.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Have I had children's voices?
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>The people are incensed against him.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Stop,
</br>Or all will fall in broil.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Are these your herd?
</br>Must these have voices, that can yield them now
</br>And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
</br>your offices?
</br>You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
</br>Have you not set them on?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Be calm, be calm.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
</br>To curb the will of the nobility:
</br>Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
</br>Nor ever will be ruled.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Call't not a plot:
</br>The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
</br>When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
</br>Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
</br>Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Why, this was known before.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Not to them all.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Have you inform'd them sithence?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>How! I inform them!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>You are like to do such business.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Not unlike,
</br>Each way, to better yours.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
</br>Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
</br>Your fellow tribune.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>You show too much of that
</br>For which the people stir: if you will pass
</br>To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
</br>Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
</br>Or never be so noble as a consul,
</br>Nor yoke with him for tribune.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Let's be calm.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>The people are abused; set on. This paltering
</br>Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
</br>Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
</br>I' the plain way of his merit.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Tell me of corn!
</br>This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Not now, not now.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Not in this heat, sir, now.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
</br>I crave their pardons:
</br>For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
</br>Regard me as I do not flatter, and
</br>Therein behold themselves: I say again,
</br>In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
</br>The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
</br>Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
</br>and scatter'd,
</br>By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
</br>Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
</br>Which they have given to beggars.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Well, no more.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>No more words, we beseech you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>How! no more!
</br>As for my country I have shed my blood,
</br>Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
</br>Coin words till their decay against those measles,
</br>Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
</br>The very way to catch them.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>You speak o' the people,
</br>As if you were a god to punish, not
</br>A man of their infirmity.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>'Twere well
</br>We let the people know't.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>What, what? his choler?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Choler!
</br>Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
</br>By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>It is a mind
</br>That shall remain a poison where it is,
</br>Not poison any further.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Shall remain!
</br>Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
</br>His absolute 'shall'?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>'Twas from the canon.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>'Shall'!
</br>O good but most unwise patricians! why,
</br>You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
</br>Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
</br>That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
</br>The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
</br>To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
</br>And make your channel his? If he have power
</br>Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
</br>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
</br>Be not as common fools; if you are not,
</br>Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
</br>If they be senators: and they are no less,
</br>When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
</br>Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
</br>And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
</br>His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
</br>Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
</br>It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
</br>To know, when two authorities are up,
</br>Neither supreme, how soon confusion
</br>May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
</br>The one by the other.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Well, on to the market-place.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
</br>The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
</br>Sometime in Greece,--
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Well, well, no more of that.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Though there the people had more absolute power,
</br>I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
</br>The ruin of the state.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Why, shall the people give
</br>One that speaks thus their voice?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I'll give my reasons,
</br>More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
</br>Was not our recompense, resting well assured
</br>That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
</br>Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
</br>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
</br>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
</br>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
</br>Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
</br>Which they have often made against the senate,
</br>All cause unborn, could never be the motive
</br>Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
</br>How shall this bisson multitude digest
</br>The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
</br>What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
</br>We are the greater poll, and in true fear
</br>They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
</br>The nature of our seats and make the rabble
</br>Call our cares fears; which will in time
</br>Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
</br>The crows to peck the eagles.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Come, enough.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Enough, with over-measure.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>No, take more:
</br>What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
</br>Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
</br>Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
</br>Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
</br>Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
</br>Of general ignorance,--it must omit
</br>Real necessities, and give way the while
</br>To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
</br>it follows,
</br>Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
</br>You that will be less fearful than discreet,
</br>That love the fundamental part of state
</br>More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
</br>A noble life before a long, and wish
</br>To jump a body with a dangerous physic
</br>That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
</br>The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
</br>The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
</br>Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
</br>Of that integrity which should become't,
</br>Not having the power to do the good it would,
</br>For the in which doth control't.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Has said enough.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
</br>As traitors do.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
</br>What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
</br>On whom depending, their obedience fails
</br>To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
</br>When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
</br>Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
</br>Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
</br>And throw their power i' the dust.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Manifest treason!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>This a consul? no.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>The aediles, ho!
</br>Let him be apprehended.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Go, call the people:
</br>in whose name myself
</br>Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
</br>A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
</br>And follow to thine answer.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Hence, old goat!
</br>
</br>Senators, &C:
</br>We'll surety him.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Aged sir, hands off.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
</br>Out of thy garments.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Help, ye citizens!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>On both sides more respect.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Here's he that would take from you all your power.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Seize him, AEdiles!
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>Down with him! down with him!
</br>
</br>Senators, &C:
</br>Weapons, weapons, weapons!
</br>'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
</br>'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
</br>'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>What is about to be? I am out of breath;
</br>Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
</br>To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
</br>Speak, good Sicinius.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Hear me, people; peace!
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>You are at point to lose your liberties:
</br>Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
</br>Whom late you have named for consul.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Fie, fie, fie!
</br>This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>What is the city but the people?
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>True,
</br>The people are the city.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>By the consent of all, we were establish'd
</br>The people's magistrates.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>You so remain.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>And so are like to do.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>That is the way to lay the city flat;
</br>To bring the roof to the foundation,
</br>And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
</br>In heaps and piles of ruin.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>This deserves death.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Or let us stand to our authority,
</br>Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
</br>Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
</br>We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
</br>Of present death.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Therefore lay hold of him;
</br>Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
</br>Into destruction cast him.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>AEdiles, seize him!
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>Yield, Marcius, yield!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Hear me one word;
</br>Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>Peace, peace!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Sir, those cold ways,
</br>That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
</br>Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
</br>And bear him to the rock.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>No, I'll die here.
</br>There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
</br>Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Lay hands upon him.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Help Marcius, help,
</br>You that be noble; help him, young and old!
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>Down with him, down with him!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
</br>All will be naught else.
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>Get you gone.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Stand fast;
</br>We have as many friends as enemies.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Sham it be put to that?
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>The gods forbid!
</br>I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
</br>Leave us to cure this cause.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>For 'tis a sore upon us,
</br>You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Come, sir, along with us.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I would they were barbarians--as they are,
</br>Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
</br>Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Be gone;
</br>Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
</br>One time will owe another.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>On fair ground
</br>I could beat forty of them.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>I could myself
</br>Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
</br>two tribunes:
</br>But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
</br>And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
</br>Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
</br>Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
</br>Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
</br>What they are used to bear.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Pray you, be gone:
</br>I'll try whether my old wit be in request
</br>With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
</br>With cloth of any colour.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Nay, come away.
</br>
</br>A Patrician:
</br>This man has marr'd his fortune.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>His nature is too noble for the world:
</br>He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
</br>Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
</br>What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
</br>And, being angry, does forget that ever
</br>He heard the name of death.
</br>Here's goodly work!
</br>
</br>Second Patrician:
</br>I would they were abed!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
</br>Could he not speak 'em fair?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Where is this viper
</br>That would depopulate the city and
</br>Be every man himself?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>You worthy tribunes,--
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
</br>With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
</br>And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
</br>Than the severity of the public power
</br>Which he so sets at nought.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>He shall well know
</br>The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
</br>And we their hands.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>He shall, sure on't.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Sir, sir,--
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Peace!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
</br>With modest warrant.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Sir, how comes't that you
</br>Have holp to make this rescue?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Hear me speak:
</br>As I do know the consul's worthiness,
</br>So can I name his faults,--
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Consul! what consul?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>The consul Coriolanus.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>He consul!
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>No, no, no, no, no.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
</br>I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
</br>The which shall turn you to no further harm
</br>Than so much loss of time.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Speak briefly then;
</br>For we are peremptory to dispatch
</br>This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
</br>Were but one danger, and to keep him here
</br>Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
</br>He dies to-night.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Now the good gods forbid
</br>That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
</br>Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
</br>In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
</br>Should now eat up her own!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>He's a disease that must be cut away.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
</br>Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
</br>What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
</br>Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
</br>Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
</br>By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
</br>And what is left, to lose it by his country,
</br>Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
</br>A brand to the end o' the world.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>This is clean kam.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Merely awry: when he did love his country,
</br>It honour'd him.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>The service of the foot
</br>Being once gangrened, is not then respected
</br>For what before it was.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>We'll hear no more.
</br>Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
</br>Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
</br>Spread further.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>One word more, one word.
</br>This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
</br>The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
</br>Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
</br>Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
</br>And sack great Rome with Romans.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>If it were so,--
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>What do ye talk?
</br>Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
</br>Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
</br>Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
</br>In bolted language; meal and bran together
</br>He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
</br>I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
</br>Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
</br>In peace, to his utmost peril.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Noble tribunes,
</br>It is the humane way: the other course
</br>Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
</br>Unknown to the beginning.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Noble Menenius,
</br>Be you then as the people's officer.
</br>Masters, lay down your weapons.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Go not home.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
</br>Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
</br>In our first way.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I'll bring him to you.
</br>Let me desire your company: he must come,
</br>Or what is worst will follow.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Pray you, let's to him.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
</br>Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
</br>Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
</br>That the precipitation might down stretch
</br>Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
</br>Be thus to them.
</br>
</br>A Patrician:
</br>You do the nobler.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I muse my mother
</br>Does not approve me further, who was wont
</br>To call them woollen vassals, things created
</br>To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
</br>In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
</br>When one but of my ordinance stood up
</br>To speak of peace or war.
</br>I talk of you:
</br>Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
</br>False to my nature? Rather say I play
</br>The man I am.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>O, sir, sir, sir,
</br>I would have had you put your power well on,
</br>Before you had worn it out.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Let go.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>You might have been enough the man you are,
</br>With striving less to be so; lesser had been
</br>The thwartings of your dispositions, if
</br>You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
</br>Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Let them hang.
</br>
</br>A Patrician:
</br>Ay, and burn too.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Come, come, you have been too rough, something
</br>too rough;
</br>You must return and mend it.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>There's no remedy;
</br>Unless, by not so doing, our good city
</br>Cleave in the midst, and perish.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Pray, be counsell'd:
</br>I have a heart as little apt as yours,
</br>But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
</br>To better vantage.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Well said, noble woman?
</br>Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
</br>The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
</br>For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
</br>Which I can scarcely bear.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>What must I do?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Return to the tribunes.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Well, what then? what then?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Repent what you have spoke.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
</br>Must I then do't to them?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>You are too absolute;
</br>Though therein you can never be too noble,
</br>But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
</br>Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
</br>I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
</br>In peace what each of them by the other lose,
</br>That they combine not there.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Tush, tush!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>A good demand.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>If it be honour in your wars to seem
</br>The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
</br>You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
</br>That it shall hold companionship in peace
</br>With honour, as in war, since that to both
</br>It stands in like request?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Why force you this?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Because that now it lies you on to speak
</br>To the people; not by your own instruction,
</br>Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
</br>But with such words that are but rooted in
</br>Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
</br>Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
</br>Now, this no more dishonours you at all
</br>Than to take in a town with gentle words,
</br>Which else would put you to your fortune and
</br>The hazard of much blood.
</br>I would dissemble with my nature where
</br>My fortunes and my friends at stake required
</br>I should do so in honour: I am in this,
</br>Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
</br>And you will rather show our general louts
</br>How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
</br>For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
</br>Of what that want might ruin.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Noble lady!
</br>Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
</br>Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
</br>Of what is past.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>I prithee now, my son,
</br>Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
</br>And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
</br>Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
</br>Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
</br>More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
</br>Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
</br>Now humble as the ripest mulberry
</br>That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
</br>Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
</br>Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
</br>Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
</br>In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
</br>Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
</br>As thou hast power and person.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>This but done,
</br>Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
</br>For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
</br>As words to little purpose.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Prithee now,
</br>Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
</br>Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
</br>Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
</br>You make strong party, or defend yourself
</br>By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Only fair speech.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>I think 'twill serve, if he
</br>Can thereto frame his spirit.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>He must, and will
</br>Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
</br>Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
</br>A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
</br>Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
</br>This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
</br>And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
</br>You have put me now to such a part which never
</br>I shall discharge to the life.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Come, come, we'll prompt you.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
</br>My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
</br>To have my praise for this, perform a part
</br>Thou hast not done before.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Well, I must do't:
</br>Away, my disposition, and possess me
</br>Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
</br>Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
</br>Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
</br>That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
</br>Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
</br>The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
</br>Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
</br>Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
</br>That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
</br>Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
</br>And by my body's action teach my mind
</br>A most inherent baseness.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>At thy choice, then:
</br>To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
</br>Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
</br>Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
</br>Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
</br>With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
</br>Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
</br>But owe thy pride thyself.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Pray, be content:
</br>Mother, I am going to the market-place;
</br>Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
</br>Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
</br>Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
</br>Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
</br>Or never trust to what my tongue can do
</br>I' the way of flattery further.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Do your will.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
</br>To answer mildly; for they are prepared
</br>With accusations, as I hear, more strong
</br>Than are upon you yet.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
</br>Let them accuse me by invention, I
</br>Will answer in mine honour.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Ay, but mildly.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>In this point charge him home, that he affects
</br>Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
</br>Enforce him with his envy to the people,
</br>And that the spoil got on the Antiates
</br>Was ne'er distributed.
</br>What, will he come?
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>He's coming.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>How accompanied?
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>With old Menenius, and those senators
</br>That always favour'd him.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Have you a catalogue
</br>Of all the voices that we have procured
</br>Set down by the poll?
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>I have; 'tis ready.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Have you collected them by tribes?
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>I have.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Assemble presently the people hither;
</br>And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
</br>I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
</br>For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
</br>If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
</br>Insisting on the old prerogative
</br>And power i' the truth o' the cause.
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>I shall inform them.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>And when such time they have begun to cry,
</br>Let them not cease, but with a din confused
</br>Enforce the present execution
</br>Of what we chance to sentence.
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>Very well.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
</br>When we shall hap to give 't them.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Go about it.
</br>Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
</br>Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
</br>Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
</br>Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
</br>What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
</br>With us to break his neck.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Well, here he comes.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Calmly, I do beseech you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
</br>Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
</br>Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
</br>Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
</br>Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
</br>And not our streets with war!
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Amen, amen.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>A noble wish.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Draw near, ye people.
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>First, hear me speak.
</br>
</br>Both Tribunes:
</br>Well, say. Peace, ho!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Shall I be charged no further than this present?
</br>Must all determine here?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>I do demand,
</br>If you submit you to the people's voices,
</br>Allow their officers and are content
</br>To suffer lawful censure for such faults
</br>As shall be proved upon you?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I am content.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
</br>The warlike service he has done, consider; think
</br>Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
</br>Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Scratches with briers,
</br>Scars to move laughter only.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Consider further,
</br>That when he speaks not like a citizen,
</br>You find him like a soldier: do not take
</br>His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
</br>But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
</br>Rather than envy you.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Well, well, no more.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>What is the matter
</br>That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
</br>I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
</br>You take it off again?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Answer to us.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>We charge you, that you have contrived to take
</br>From Rome all season'd office and to wind
</br>Yourself into a power tyrannical;
</br>For which you are a traitor to the people.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>How! traitor!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Nay, temperately; your promise.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
</br>Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
</br>Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
</br>In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
</br>Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
</br>'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
</br>As I do pray the gods.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Mark you this, people?
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>To the rock, to the rock with him!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Peace!
</br>We need not put new matter to his charge:
</br>What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
</br>Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
</br>Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
</br>Those whose great power must try him; even this,
</br>So criminal and in such capital kind,
</br>Deserves the extremest death.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>But since he hath
</br>Served well for Rome,--
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>What do you prate of service?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>I talk of that, that know it.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>You?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Is this the promise that you made your mother?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Know, I pray you,--
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I know no further:
</br>Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
</br>Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
</br>But with a grain a day, I would not buy
</br>Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
</br>Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
</br>To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>For that he has,
</br>As much as in him lies, from time to time
</br>Envied against the people, seeking means
</br>To pluck away their power, as now at last
</br>Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
</br>Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
</br>That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
</br>And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
</br>Even from this instant, banish him our city,
</br>In peril of precipitation
</br>From off the rock Tarpeian never more
</br>To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
</br>I say it shall be so.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
</br>He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>He's sentenced; no more hearing.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Let me speak:
</br>I have been consul, and can show for Rome
</br>Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
</br>My country's good with a respect more tender,
</br>More holy and profound, than mine own life,
</br>My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
</br>And treasure of my loins; then if I would
</br>Speak that,--
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>We know your drift: speak what?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
</br>As enemy to the people and his country:
</br>It shall be so.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>It shall be so, it shall be so.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
</br>As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
</br>As the dead carcasses of unburied men
</br>That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
</br>And here remain with your uncertainty!
</br>Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
</br>Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
</br>Fan you into despair! Have the power still
</br>To banish your defenders; till at length
</br>Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
</br>Making not reservation of yourselves,
</br>Still your own foes, deliver you as most
</br>Abated captives to some nation
</br>That won you without blows! Despising,
</br>For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
</br>There is a world elsewhere.
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
</br>As he hath followed you, with all despite;
</br>Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
</br>Attend us through the city.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
</br>The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
</br>With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
</br>Where is your ancient courage? you were used
</br>To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
</br>That common chances common men could bear;
</br>That when the sea was calm all boats alike
</br>Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
</br>When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
</br>A noble cunning: you were used to load me
</br>With precepts that would make invincible
</br>The heart that conn'd them.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>O heavens! O heavens!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Nay! prithee, woman,--
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
</br>And occupations perish!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>What, what, what!
</br>I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
</br>Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
</br>If you had been the wife of Hercules,
</br>Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
</br>Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
</br>Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
</br>I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
</br>Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
</br>And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
</br>I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
</br>Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
</br>'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
</br>As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
</br>My hazards still have been your solace: and
</br>Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
</br>Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
</br>Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
</br>Will or exceed the common or be caught
</br>With cautelous baits and practise.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>My first son.
</br>Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
</br>With thee awhile: determine on some course,
</br>More than a wild exposture to each chance
</br>That starts i' the way before thee.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>O the gods!
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
</br>Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
</br>And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
</br>A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
</br>O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
</br>And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
</br>I' the absence of the needer.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Fare ye well:
</br>Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
</br>Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
</br>That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
</br>Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
</br>My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
</br>Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
</br>While I remain above the ground, you shall
</br>Hear from me still, and never of me aught
</br>But what is like me formerly.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>That's worthily
</br>As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
</br>If I could shake off but one seven years
</br>From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
</br>I'ld with thee every foot.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Give me thy hand: Come.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
</br>The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
</br>In his behalf.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Now we have shown our power,
</br>Let us seem humbler after it is done
</br>Than when it was a-doing.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Bid them home:
</br>Say their great enemy is gone, and they
</br>Stand in their ancient strength.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Dismiss them home.
</br>Here comes his mother.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Let's not meet her.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Why?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>They say she's mad.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
</br>Requite your love!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Peace, peace; be not so loud.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
</br>Nay, and you shall hear some.
</br>Will you be gone?
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Are you mankind?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
</br>Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
</br>To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
</br>Than thou hast spoken words?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>O blessed heavens!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
</br>And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
</br>Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
</br>Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
</br>His good sword in his hand.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>What then?
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>What then!
</br>He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Bastards and all.
</br>Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Come, come, peace.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>I would he had continued to his country
</br>As he began, and not unknit himself
</br>The noble knot he made.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>I would he had.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
</br>Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
</br>As I can of those mysteries which heaven
</br>Will not have earth to know.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Pray, let us go.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
</br>You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
</br>As far as doth the Capitol exceed
</br>The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
</br>This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
</br>Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Well, well, we'll leave you.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Why stay we to be baited
</br>With one that wants her wits?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Take my prayers with you.
</br>I would the gods had nothing else to do
</br>But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
</br>But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
</br>Of what lies heavy to't.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>You have told them home;
</br>And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
</br>And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
</br>Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
</br>In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Fie, fie, fie!
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>I know you well, sir, and you know
</br>me: your name, I think, is Adrian.
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>I am a Roman; and my services are,
</br>as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>Nicanor? no.
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>The same, sir.
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
</br>favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
</br>news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
</br>to find you out there: you have well saved me a
</br>day's journey.
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
</br>people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
</br>so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
</br>hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
</br>would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
</br>so to heart the banishment of that worthy
</br>Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
</br>all power from the people and to pluck from them
</br>their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
</br>tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
</br>breaking out.
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>Coriolanus banished!
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>Banished, sir.
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
</br>said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
</br>when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
</br>Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
</br>great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
</br>of his country.
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
</br>accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
</br>business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
</br>strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
</br>their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
</br>distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
</br>and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
</br>man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
</br>So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
</br>
</br>Volsce:
</br>You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
</br>to be glad of yours.
</br>
</br>Roman:
</br>Well, let us go together.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>A goodly city is this Antium. City,
</br>'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
</br>Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
</br>Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
</br>Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
</br>In puny battle slay me.
</br>Save you, sir.
</br>
</br>Citizen:
</br>And you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Direct me, if it be your will,
</br>Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?
</br>
</br>Citizen:
</br>He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
</br>At his house this night.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Which is his house, beseech you?
</br>
</br>Citizen:
</br>This, here before you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Thank you, sir: farewell.
</br>O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
</br>Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
</br>Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
</br>Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
</br>Unseparable, shall within this hour,
</br>On a dissension of a doit, break out
</br>To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
</br>Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
</br>To take the one the other, by some chance,
</br>Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
</br>And interjoin their issues. So with me:
</br>My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
</br>This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
</br>He does fair justice; if he give me way,
</br>I'll do his country service.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Wine, wine, wine! What service
</br>is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Where's Cotus? my master calls
</br>for him. Cotus!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
</br>Appear not like a guest.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>What would you have, friend? whence are you?
</br>Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I have deserved no better entertainment,
</br>In being Coriolanus.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
</br>head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
</br>Pray, get you out.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Away!
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Away! get you away.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Now thou'rt troublesome.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>What fellow's this?
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
</br>out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
</br>the house.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>What are you?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>A gentleman.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>A marvellous poor one.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>True, so I am.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
</br>station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
</br>strange guest he has here.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>And I shall.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>Where dwellest thou?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Under the canopy.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>Under the canopy!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Ay.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>Where's that?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I' the city of kites and crows.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
</br>Then thou dwellest with daws too?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>No, I serve not thy master.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
</br>mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
</br>trencher, hence!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Where is this fellow?
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
</br>disturbing the lords within.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
</br>Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>If, Tullus,
</br>Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
</br>Think me for the man I am, necessity
</br>Commands me name myself.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>What is thy name?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
</br>And harsh in sound to thine.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Say, what's thy name?
</br>Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
</br>Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
</br>Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
</br>thou me yet?
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>I know thee not: thy name?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
</br>To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
</br>Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
</br>My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
</br>The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
</br>Shed for my thankless country are requited
</br>But with that surname; a good memory,
</br>And witness of the malice and displeasure
</br>Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
</br>The cruelty and envy of the people,
</br>Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
</br>Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
</br>And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
</br>Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
</br>Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
</br>Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
</br>I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
</br>I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
</br>To be full quit of those my banishers,
</br>Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
</br>A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
</br>Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
</br>Of shame seen through thy country, speed
</br>thee straight,
</br>And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
</br>That my revengeful services may prove
</br>As benefits to thee, for I will fight
</br>Against my canker'd country with the spleen
</br>Of all the under fiends. But if so be
</br>Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
</br>Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
</br>Longer to live most weary, and present
</br>My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
</br>Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
</br>Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
</br>Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
</br>And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
</br>It be to do thee service.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>O Marcius, Marcius!
</br>Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
</br>A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
</br>Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
</br>And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
</br>Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
</br>Mine arms about that body, where against
</br>My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
</br>And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
</br>The anvil of my sword, and do contest
</br>As hotly and as nobly with thy love
</br>As ever in ambitious strength I did
</br>Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
</br>I loved the maid I married; never man
</br>Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
</br>Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
</br>Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
</br>Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
</br>We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
</br>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
</br>Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
</br>Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
</br>Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
</br>We have been down together in my sleep,
</br>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
</br>And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
</br>Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
</br>Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
</br>From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
</br>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
</br>Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
</br>And take our friendly senators by the hands;
</br>Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
</br>Who am prepared against your territories,
</br>Though not for Rome itself.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>You bless me, gods!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
</br>The leading of thine own revenges, take
</br>The one half of my commission; and set down--
</br>As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
</br>Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
</br>Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
</br>Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
</br>To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
</br>Let me commend thee first to those that shall
</br>Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
</br>And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
</br>Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Here's a strange alteration!
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
</br>a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
</br>false report of him.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
</br>finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
</br>him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
</br>cannot tell how to term it.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
</br>but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
</br>man i' the world.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Who, my master?
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Nay, it's no matter for that.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Worth six on him.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
</br>greater soldier.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
</br>for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Ay, and for an assault too.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>What, what, what? let's partake.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
</br>lieve be a condemned man.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Wherefore? wherefore?
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
</br>Caius Marcius.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
</br>good enough for him.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
</br>hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
</br>on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
</br>him like a carbon ado.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>An he had been cannibally given, he might have
</br>broiled and eaten him too.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>But, more of thy news?
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
</br>and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
</br>question asked him by any of the senators, but they
</br>stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
</br>mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
</br>turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
</br>the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
</br>the middle and but one half of what he was
</br>yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
</br>and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
</br>and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
</br>will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
</br>many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
</br>were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
</br>we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Directitude! what's that?
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
</br>and the man in blood, they will out of their
</br>burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
</br>him.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>But when goes this forward?
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
</br>drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
</br>parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
</br>wipe their lips.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
</br>This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
</br>tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
</br>day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
</br>full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
</br>mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
</br>bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
</br>
</br>Second Servingman:
</br>'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
</br>be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
</br>great maker of cuckolds.
</br>
</br>First Servingman:
</br>Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
</br>
</br>Third Servingman:
</br>Reason; because they then less need one another.
</br>The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
</br>as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>In, in, in, in!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
</br>His remedies are tame i' the present peace
</br>And quietness of the people, which before
</br>Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
</br>Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
</br>Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
</br>Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
</br>Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
</br>About their functions friendly.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>We stood to't in good time.
</br>Is this Menenius?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
</br>
</br>Both Tribunes:
</br>Hail sir!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Hail to you both!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Your Coriolanus
</br>Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
</br>The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
</br>Were he more angry at it.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>All's well; and might have been much better, if
</br>He could have temporized.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Where is he, hear you?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
</br>Hear nothing from him.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>The gods preserve you both!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>God-den, our neighbours.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
</br>Are bound to pray for you both.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Live, and thrive!
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
</br>Had loved you as we did.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>Now the gods keep you!
</br>
</br>Both Tribunes:
</br>Farewell, farewell.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>This is a happier and more comely time
</br>Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
</br>Crying confusion.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Caius Marcius was
</br>A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
</br>O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
</br>Self-loving,--
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>And affecting one sole throne,
</br>Without assistance.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I think not so.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>We should by this, to all our lamentation,
</br>If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
</br>Sits safe and still without him.
</br>
</br>AEdile:
</br>Worthy tribunes,
</br>There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
</br>Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
</br>Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
</br>And with the deepest malice of the war
</br>Destroy what lies before 'em.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>'Tis Aufidius,
</br>Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
</br>Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
</br>Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
</br>And durst not once peep out.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Come, what talk you
</br>Of Marcius?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
</br>The Volsces dare break with us.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Cannot be!
</br>We have record that very well it can,
</br>And three examples of the like have been
</br>Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
</br>Before you punish him, where he heard this,
</br>Lest you shall chance to whip your information
</br>And beat the messenger who bids beware
</br>Of what is to be dreaded.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Tell not me:
</br>I know this cannot be.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Not possible.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>The nobles in great earnestness are going
</br>All to the senate-house: some news is come
</br>That turns their countenances.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>'Tis this slave;--
</br>Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
</br>Nothing but his report.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Yes, worthy sir,
</br>The slave's report is seconded; and more,
</br>More fearful, is deliver'd.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>What more fearful?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
</br>How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
</br>Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
</br>And vows revenge as spacious as between
</br>The young'st and oldest thing.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>This is most likely!
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
</br>Good Marcius home again.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>The very trick on't.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>This is unlikely:
</br>He and Aufidius can no more atone
</br>Than violentest contrariety.
</br>
</br>Second Messenger:
</br>You are sent for to the senate:
</br>A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
</br>Associated with Aufidius, rages
</br>Upon our territories; and have already
</br>O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
</br>What lay before them.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>O, you have made good work!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>What news? what news?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
</br>To melt the city leads upon your pates,
</br>To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>What's the news? what's the news?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Your temples burned in their cement, and
</br>Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
</br>Into an auger's bore.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Pray now, your news?
</br>You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
</br>If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>If!
</br>He is their god: he leads them like a thing
</br>Made by some other deity than nature,
</br>That shapes man better; and they follow him,
</br>Against us brats, with no less confidence
</br>Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
</br>Or butchers killing flies.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>You have made good work,
</br>You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
</br>on the voice of occupation and
</br>The breath of garlic-eaters!
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>He will shake
</br>Your Rome about your ears.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>As Hercules
</br>Did shake down mellow fruit.
</br>You have made fair work!
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>But is this true, sir?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Ay; and you'll look pale
</br>Before you find it other. All the regions
</br>Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
</br>Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
</br>And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
</br>Your enemies and his find something in him.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>We are all undone, unless
</br>The noble man have mercy.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Who shall ask it?
</br>The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
</br>Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
</br>Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
</br>Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
</br>As those should do that had deserved his hate,
</br>And therein show'd like enemies.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>'Tis true:
</br>If he were putting to my house the brand
</br>That should consume it, I have not the face
</br>To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
</br>You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>You have brought
</br>A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
</br>So incapable of help.
</br>
</br>Both Tribunes:
</br>Say not we brought it.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
</br>And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
</br>Who did hoot him out o' the city.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>But I fear
</br>They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
</br>The second name of men, obeys his points
</br>As if he were his officer: desperation
</br>Is all the policy, strength and defence,
</br>That Rome can make against them.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Here come the clusters.
</br>And is Aufidius with him? You are they
</br>That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
</br>Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
</br>Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
</br>And not a hair upon a soldier's head
</br>Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
</br>As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
</br>And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
</br>if he could burn us all into one coal,
</br>We have deserved it.
</br>
</br>Citizens:
</br>Faith, we hear fearful news.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>For mine own part,
</br>When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>And so did I.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
</br>many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
</br>though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
</br>it was against our will.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Ye re goodly things, you voices!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>You have made
</br>Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>O, ay, what else?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
</br>These are a side that would be glad to have
</br>This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
</br>And show no sign of fear.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
</br>I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
</br>him.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>So did we all. But, come, let's home.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>I do not like this news.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Nor I.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
</br>Would buy this for a lie!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Pray, let us go.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Do they still fly to the Roman?
</br>
</br>Lieutenant:
</br>I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
</br>Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
</br>Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
</br>And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
</br>Even by your own.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>I cannot help it now,
</br>Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
</br>Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
</br>Even to my person, than I thought he would
</br>When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
</br>In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
</br>What cannot be amended.
</br>
</br>Lieutenant:
</br>Yet I wish, sir,--
</br>I mean for your particular,--you had not
</br>Join'd in commission with him; but either
</br>Had borne the action of yourself, or else
</br>To him had left it solely.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
</br>when he shall come to his account, he knows not
</br>What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
</br>And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
</br>To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
</br>And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
</br>Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
</br>As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
</br>That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
</br>Whene'er we come to our account.
</br>
</br>Lieutenant:
</br>Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>All places yield to him ere he sits down;
</br>And the nobility of Rome are his:
</br>The senators and patricians love him too:
</br>The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
</br>Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
</br>To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
</br>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
</br>By sovereignty of nature. First he was
</br>A noble servant to them; but he could not
</br>Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
</br>Which out of daily fortune ever taints
</br>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
</br>To fail in the disposing of those chances
</br>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
</br>Not to be other than one thing, not moving
</br>From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
</br>Even with the same austerity and garb
</br>As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
</br>As he hath spices of them all, not all,
</br>For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
</br>So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
</br>To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
</br>Lie in the interpretation of the time:
</br>And power, unto itself most commendable,
</br>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
</br>To extol what it hath done.
</br>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
</br>Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
</br>Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
</br>Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
</br>Which was sometime his general; who loved him
</br>In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
</br>But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
</br>A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
</br>The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
</br>To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>He would not seem to know me.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Do you hear?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>Yet one time he did call me by my name:
</br>I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
</br>That we have bled together. Coriolanus
</br>He would not answer to: forbad all names;
</br>He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
</br>Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
</br>Of burning Rome.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Why, so: you have made good work!
</br>A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
</br>To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
</br>When it was less expected: he replied,
</br>It was a bare petition of a state
</br>To one whom they had punish'd.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Very well:
</br>Could he say less?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>I offer'd to awaken his regard
</br>For's private friends: his answer to me was,
</br>He could not stay to pick them in a pile
</br>Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
</br>For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
</br>And still to nose the offence.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>For one poor grain or two!
</br>I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
</br>And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
</br>You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
</br>Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
</br>In this so never-needed help, yet do not
</br>Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
</br>Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
</br>More than the instant army we can make,
</br>Might stop our countryman.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>No, I'll not meddle.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Pray you, go to him.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>What should I do?
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>Only make trial what your love can do
</br>For Rome, towards Marcius.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Well, and say that Marcius
</br>Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
</br>Unheard; what then?
</br>But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
</br>With his unkindness? say't be so?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Yet your good will
</br>must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
</br>As you intended well.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I'll undertake 't:
</br>I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
</br>And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
</br>He was not taken well; he had not dined:
</br>The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
</br>We pout upon the morning, are unapt
</br>To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
</br>These and these conveyances of our blood
</br>With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
</br>Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
</br>Till he be dieted to my request,
</br>And then I'll set upon him.
</br>
</br>BRUTUS:
</br>You know the very road into his kindness,
</br>And cannot lose your way.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Good faith, I'll prove him,
</br>Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
</br>Of my success.
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>He'll never hear him.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Not?
</br>
</br>COMINIUS:
</br>I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
</br>Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
</br>The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
</br>'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
</br>Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
</br>He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
</br>Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
</br>So that all hope is vain.
</br>Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
</br>Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
</br>For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
</br>And with our fair entreaties haste them on.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Stay: whence are you?
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>Stand, and go back.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
</br>I am an officer of state, and come
</br>To speak with Coriolanus.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>From whence?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>From Rome.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>You may not pass, you must return: our general
</br>Will no more hear from thence.
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
</br>You'll speak with Coriolanus.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Good my friends,
</br>If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
</br>And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
</br>My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
</br>Is not here passable.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I tell thee, fellow,
</br>The general is my lover: I have been
</br>The book of his good acts, whence men have read
</br>His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
</br>For I have ever verified my friends,
</br>Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
</br>Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
</br>Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
</br>I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
</br>Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
</br>I must have leave to pass.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
</br>behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
</br>should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
</br>to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
</br>always factionary on the party of your general.
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
</br>have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
</br>say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
</br>speak with him till after dinner.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>You are a Roman, are you?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I am, as thy general is.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
</br>when you have pushed out your gates the very
</br>defender of them, and, in a violent popular
</br>ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
</br>front his revenges with the easy groans of old
</br>women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
</br>the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
</br>you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
</br>intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
</br>such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
</br>therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
</br>execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
</br>you out of reprieve and pardon.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
</br>use me with estimation.
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>Come, my captain knows you not.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I mean, thy general.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
</br>I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
</br>the utmost of your having: back.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>What's the matter?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
</br>You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
</br>perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
</br>my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
</br>with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
</br>hanging, or of some death more long in
</br>spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
</br>presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
</br>The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
</br>particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
</br>thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
</br>thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
</br>water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
</br>thee; but being assured none but myself could move
</br>thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
</br>sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
</br>petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
</br>wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
</br>here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
</br>access to thee.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Away!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>How! away!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
</br>Are servanted to others: though I owe
</br>My revenge properly, my remission lies
</br>In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
</br>Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
</br>Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
</br>Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
</br>Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
</br>Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
</br>And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
</br>I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
</br>Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>You keep a constant temper.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
</br>way home again.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
</br>greatness back?
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I neither care for the world nor your general: for
</br>such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
</br>ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
</br>himself fears it not from another: let your general
</br>do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
</br>your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
</br>as I was said to, Away!
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>A noble fellow, I warrant him.
</br>
</br>Second Senator:
</br>The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
</br>oak not to be wind-shaken.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
</br>Set down our host. My partner in this action,
</br>You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
</br>I have borne this business.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Only their ends
</br>You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
</br>The general suit of Rome; never admitted
</br>A private whisper, no, not with such friends
</br>That thought them sure of you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>This last old man,
</br>Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
</br>Loved me above the measure of a father;
</br>Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
</br>Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
</br>Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
</br>The first conditions, which they did refuse
</br>And cannot now accept; to grace him only
</br>That thought he could do more, a very little
</br>I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
</br>Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
</br>Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
</br>Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
</br>In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
</br>My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
</br>Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
</br>The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
</br>All bond and privilege of nature, break!
</br>Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
</br>What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
</br>Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
</br>Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
</br>As if Olympus to a molehill should
</br>In supplication nod: and my young boy
</br>Hath an aspect of intercession, which
</br>Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
</br>Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
</br>Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
</br>As if a man were author of himself
</br>And knew no other kin.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>My lord and husband!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
</br>Makes you think so.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Like a dull actor now,
</br>I have forgot my part, and I am out,
</br>Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
</br>Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
</br>For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
</br>Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
</br>Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
</br>I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
</br>Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
</br>And the most noble mother of the world
</br>Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
</br>Of thy deep duty more impression show
</br>Than that of common sons.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>O, stand up blest!
</br>Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
</br>I kneel before thee; and unproperly
</br>Show duty, as mistaken all this while
</br>Between the child and parent.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>What is this?
</br>Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
</br>Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
</br>Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
</br>Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
</br>Murdering impossibility, to make
</br>What cannot be, slight work.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Thou art my warrior;
</br>I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>The noble sister of Publicola,
</br>The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
</br>That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
</br>And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>This is a poor epitome of yours,
</br>Which by the interpretation of full time
</br>May show like all yourself.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>The god of soldiers,
</br>With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
</br>Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
</br>To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
</br>Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
</br>And saving those that eye thee!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Your knee, sirrah.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>That's my brave boy!
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
</br>Are suitors to you.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I beseech you, peace:
</br>Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
</br>The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
</br>Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
</br>Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
</br>Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
</br>Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
</br>To ally my rages and revenges with
</br>Your colder reasons.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>O, no more, no more!
</br>You have said you will not grant us any thing;
</br>For we have nothing else to ask, but that
</br>Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
</br>That, if you fail in our request, the blame
</br>May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
</br>Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
</br>And state of bodies would bewray what life
</br>We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
</br>How more unfortunate than all living women
</br>Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
</br>which should
</br>Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
</br>with comforts,
</br>Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
</br>Making the mother, wife and child to see
</br>The son, the husband and the father tearing
</br>His country's bowels out. And to poor we
</br>Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
</br>Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
</br>That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
</br>Alas, how can we for our country pray.
</br>Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
</br>Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
</br>The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
</br>Our comfort in the country. We must find
</br>An evident calamity, though we had
</br>Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
</br>Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
</br>With manacles thorough our streets, or else
</br>triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
</br>And bear the palm for having bravely shed
</br>Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
</br>I purpose not to wait on fortune till
</br>These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
</br>Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
</br>Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
</br>March to assault thy country than to tread--
</br>Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
</br>That brought thee to this world.
</br>
</br>VIRGILIA:
</br>Ay, and mine,
</br>That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
</br>Living to time.
</br>
</br>Young MARCIUS:
</br>A' shall not tread on me;
</br>I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
</br>Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
</br>I have sat too long.
</br>
</br>VOLUMNIA:
</br>Nay, go not from us thus.
</br>If it were so that our request did tend
</br>To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
</br>The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
</br>As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
</br>Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
</br>May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
</br>'This we received;' and each in either side
</br>Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
</br>For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
</br>The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
</br>That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
</br>Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
</br>Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
</br>Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
</br>But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
</br>Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
</br>To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
</br>Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
</br>To imitate the graces of the gods;
</br>To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
</br>And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
</br>That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
</br>Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
</br>Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
</br>He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
</br>Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
</br>Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
</br>More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
</br>Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
</br>Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
</br>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
</br>Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
</br>Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
</br>And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
</br>Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
</br>That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
</br>To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
</br>Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
</br>To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
</br>Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
</br>This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
</br>And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
</br>This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
</br>But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
</br>Does reason our petition with more strength
</br>Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
</br>This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
</br>His wife is in Corioli and his child
</br>Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
</br>I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
</br>And then I'll speak a little.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>O mother, mother!
</br>What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
</br>The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
</br>They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
</br>You have won a happy victory to Rome;
</br>But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
</br>Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
</br>If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
</br>Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
</br>I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
</br>Were you in my stead, would you have heard
</br>A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>I was moved withal.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>I dare be sworn you were:
</br>And, sir, it is no little thing to make
</br>Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
</br>What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
</br>I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
</br>Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Ay, by and by;
</br>But we will drink together; and you shall bear
</br>A better witness back than words, which we,
</br>On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
</br>Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
</br>To have a temple built you: all the swords
</br>In Italy, and her confederate arms,
</br>Could not have made this peace.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
</br>corner-stone?
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Why, what of that?
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>If it be possible for you to displace it with your
</br>little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
</br>Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
</br>But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
</br>sentenced and stay upon execution.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
</br>condition of a man!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
</br>yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
</br>from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
</br>creeping thing.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>He loved his mother dearly.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
</br>now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
</br>of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
</br>moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
</br>his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
</br>his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
</br>battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
</br>Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
</br>his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
</br>and a heaven to throne in.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
</br>mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
</br>in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
</br>shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
</br>you.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>The gods be good unto us!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
</br>us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
</br>and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
</br>The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
</br>And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
</br>The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
</br>They'll give him death by inches.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>What's the news?
</br>
</br>Second Messenger:
</br>Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
</br>The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
</br>A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
</br>No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>Friend,
</br>Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
</br>
</br>Second Messenger:
</br>As certain as I know the sun is fire:
</br>Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
</br>Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
</br>As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
</br>The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
</br>Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
</br>Make the sun dance. Hark you!
</br>
</br>MENENIUS:
</br>This is good news:
</br>I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
</br>Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
</br>A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
</br>A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
</br>This morning for ten thousand of your throats
</br>I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
</br>Accept my thankfulness.
</br>
</br>Second Messenger:
</br>Sir, we have all
</br>Great cause to give great thanks.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>They are near the city?
</br>
</br>Second Messenger:
</br>Almost at point to enter.
</br>
</br>SICINIUS:
</br>We will meet them,
</br>And help the joy.
</br>
</br>First Senator:
</br>Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
</br>Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
</br>And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
</br>Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
</br>Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
</br>Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
</br>Deliver them this paper: having read it,
</br>Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
</br>Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
</br>Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
</br>The city ports by this hath enter'd and
</br>Intends to appear before the people, hoping
</br>To purge herself with words: dispatch.
</br>Most welcome!
</br>
</br>First Conspirator:
</br>How is it with our general?
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Even so
</br>As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
</br>And with his charity slain.
</br>
</br>Second Conspirator:
</br>Most noble sir,
</br>If you do hold the same intent wherein
</br>You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
</br>Of your great danger.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Sir, I cannot tell:
</br>We must proceed as we do find the people.
</br>
</br>Third Conspirator:
</br>The people will remain uncertain whilst
</br>'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
</br>Makes the survivor heir of all.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>I know it;
</br>And my pretext to strike at him admits
</br>A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
</br>Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
</br>He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
</br>Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
</br>He bow'd his nature, never known before
</br>But to be rough, unswayable and free.
</br>
</br>Third Conspirator:
</br>Sir, his stoutness
</br>When he did stand for consul, which he lost
</br>By lack of stooping,--
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>That I would have spoke of:
</br>Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
</br>Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
</br>Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
</br>In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
</br>Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
</br>My best and freshest men; served his designments
</br>In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
</br>Which he did end all his; and took some pride
</br>To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
</br>I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
</br>He waged me with his countenance, as if
</br>I had been mercenary.
</br>
</br>First Conspirator:
</br>So he did, my lord:
</br>The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
</br>When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
</br>For no less spoil than glory,--
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>There was it:
</br>For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
</br>At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
</br>As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
</br>Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
</br>And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
</br>
</br>First Conspirator:
</br>Your native town you enter'd like a post,
</br>And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
</br>Splitting the air with noise.
</br>
</br>Second Conspirator:
</br>And patient fools,
</br>Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
</br>With giving him glory.
</br>
</br>Third Conspirator:
</br>Therefore, at your vantage,
</br>Ere he express himself, or move the people
</br>With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
</br>Which we will second. When he lies along,
</br>After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
</br>His reasons with his body.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Say no more:
</br>Here come the lords.
</br>
</br>All The Lords:
</br>You are most welcome home.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>I have not deserved it.
</br>But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
</br>What I have written to you?
</br>
</br>Lords:
</br>We have.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>And grieve to hear't.
</br>What faults he made before the last, I think
</br>Might have found easy fines: but there to end
</br>Where he was to begin and give away
</br>The benefit of our levies, answering us
</br>With our own charge, making a treaty where
</br>There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>He approaches: you shall hear him.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
</br>No more infected with my country's love
</br>Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
</br>Under your great command. You are to know
</br>That prosperously I have attempted and
</br>With bloody passage led your wars even to
</br>The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
</br>Do more than counterpoise a full third part
</br>The charges of the action. We have made peace
</br>With no less honour to the Antiates
</br>Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
</br>Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
</br>Together with the seal o' the senate, what
</br>We have compounded on.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Read it not, noble lords;
</br>But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
</br>He hath abused your powers.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Traitor! how now!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Ay, traitor, Marcius!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Marcius!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
</br>I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
</br>Coriolanus in Corioli?
</br>You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
</br>He has betray'd your business, and given up,
</br>For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
</br>I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
</br>Breaking his oath and resolution like
</br>A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
</br>Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
</br>He whined and roar'd away your victory,
</br>That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
</br>Look'd wondering each at other.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Hear'st thou, Mars?
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Ha!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>No more.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
</br>Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
</br>Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
</br>I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
</br>Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
</br>Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
</br>Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
</br>To thrust the lie unto him.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>Peace, both, and hear me speak.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
</br>Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
</br>If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
</br>That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
</br>Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
</br>Alone I did it. Boy!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Why, noble lords,
</br>Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
</br>Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
</br>'Fore your own eyes and ears?
</br>
</br>All Conspirators:
</br>Let him die for't.
</br>
</br>All The People:
</br>'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
</br>my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
</br>Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
</br>
</br>Second Lord:
</br>Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
</br>The man is noble and his fame folds-in
</br>This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
</br>Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
</br>And trouble not the peace.
</br>
</br>CORIOLANUS:
</br>O that I had him,
</br>With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
</br>To use my lawful sword!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>Insolent villain!
</br>
</br>All Conspirators:
</br>Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
</br>
</br>Lords:
</br>Hold, hold, hold, hold!
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>My noble masters, hear me speak.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>O Tullus,--
</br>
</br>Second Lord:
</br>Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
</br>
</br>Third Lord:
</br>Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
</br>Put up your swords.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
</br>Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
</br>Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
</br>That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
</br>To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
</br>Myself your loyal servant, or endure
</br>Your heaviest censure.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>Bear from hence his body;
</br>And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
</br>As the most noble corse that ever herald
</br>Did follow to his urn.
</br>
</br>Second Lord:
</br>His own impatience
</br>Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
</br>Let's make the best of it.
</br>
</br>AUFIDIUS:
</br>My rage is gone;
</br>And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
</br>Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
</br>Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
</br>Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
</br>Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
</br>Which to this hour bewail the injury,
</br>Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Now is the winter of our discontent
</br>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
</br>And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
</br>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
</br>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
</br>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
</br>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
</br>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
</br>Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
</br>And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
</br>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
</br>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
</br>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
</br>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
</br>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
</br>I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
</br>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
</br>I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
</br>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
</br>Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
</br>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
</br>And that so lamely and unfashionable
</br>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
</br>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
</br>Have no delight to pass away the time,
</br>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
</br>And descant on mine own deformity:
</br>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
</br>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
</br>I am determined to prove a villain
</br>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
</br>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
</br>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
</br>To set my brother Clarence and the king
</br>In deadly hate the one against the other:
</br>And if King Edward be as true and just
</br>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
</br>This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
</br>About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
</br>Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
</br>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
</br>Clarence comes.
</br>Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
</br>That waits upon your grace?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>His majesty
</br>Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
</br>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Upon what cause?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Because my name is George.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
</br>He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
</br>O, belike his majesty hath some intent
</br>That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
</br>But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
</br>As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
</br>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
</br>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
</br>And says a wizard told him that by G
</br>His issue disinherited should be;
</br>And, for my name of George begins with G,
</br>It follows in his thought that I am he.
</br>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
</br>Have moved his highness to commit me now.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
</br>'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
</br>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
</br>That tempers him to this extremity.
</br>Was it not she and that good man of worship,
</br>Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
</br>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
</br>From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
</br>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
</br>But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
</br>That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
</br>Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
</br>Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Humbly complaining to her deity
</br>Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
</br>I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
</br>If we will keep in favour with the king,
</br>To be her men and wear her livery:
</br>The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
</br>Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
</br>Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
</br>His majesty hath straitly given in charge
</br>That no man shall have private conference,
</br>Of what degree soever, with his brother.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
</br>You may partake of any thing we say:
</br>We speak no treason, man: we say the king
</br>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
</br>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
</br>We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
</br>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
</br>And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
</br>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
</br>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
</br>Were best he do it secretly, alone.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>What one, my lord?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
</br>Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
</br>Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
</br>And whatsoever you will employ me in,
</br>Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
</br>I will perform it to enfranchise you.
</br>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
</br>Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
</br>Meantime, have patience.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>I must perforce. Farewell.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
</br>Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
</br>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
</br>If heaven will take the present at our hands.
</br>But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
</br>Well are you welcome to the open air.
</br>How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
</br>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
</br>That were the cause of my imprisonment.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
</br>For they that were your enemies are his,
</br>And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
</br>While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>What news abroad?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>No news so bad abroad as this at home;
</br>The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
</br>And his physicians fear him mightily.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
</br>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
</br>And overmuch consumed his royal person:
</br>'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
</br>What, is he in his bed?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>He is.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Go you before, and I will follow you.
</br>He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
</br>Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
</br>I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
</br>With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
</br>And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
</br>Clarence hath not another day to live:
</br>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
</br>And leave the world for me to bustle in!
</br>For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
</br>What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
</br>The readiest way to make the wench amends
</br>Is to become her husband and her father:
</br>The which will I; not all so much for love
</br>As for another secret close intent,
</br>By marrying her which I must reach unto.
</br>But yet I run before my horse to market:
</br>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
</br>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Set down, set down your honourable load,
</br>If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
</br>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
</br>The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
</br>Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
</br>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
</br>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
</br>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
</br>To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
</br>Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
</br>Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
</br>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
</br>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
</br>Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
</br>Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
</br>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
</br>More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
</br>That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
</br>Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
</br>Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
</br>If ever he have child, abortive be it,
</br>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
</br>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
</br>May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
</br>And that be heir to his unhappiness!
</br>If ever he have wife, let her he made
</br>A miserable by the death of him
</br>As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
</br>Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
</br>Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
</br>And still, as you are weary of the weight,
</br>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>What black magician conjures up this fiend,
</br>To stop devoted charitable deeds?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
</br>I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
</br>
</br>Gentleman:
</br>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
</br>Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
</br>Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
</br>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
</br>Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
</br>And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
</br>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
</br>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
</br>His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
</br>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
</br>Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
</br>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
</br>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
</br>O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
</br>Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
</br>Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
</br>For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
</br>From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
</br>Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
</br>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
</br>O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
</br>O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
</br>Either heaven with lightning strike the
</br>murderer dead,
</br>Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
</br>As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
</br>Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Lady, you know no rules of charity,
</br>Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
</br>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
</br>Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
</br>Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
</br>By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
</br>For these known evils, but to give me leave,
</br>By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
</br>Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
</br>No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>By such despair, I should accuse myself.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
</br>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
</br>Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Say that I slew them not?
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Why, then they are not dead:
</br>But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I did not kill your husband.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Why, then he is alive.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
</br>Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
</br>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
</br>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
</br>which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
</br>Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
</br>Didst thou not kill this king?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I grant ye.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
</br>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
</br>O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
</br>For he was fitter for that place than earth.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>And thou unfit for any place but hell.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Some dungeon.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Your bed-chamber.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>So will it, madam till I lie with you.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>I hope so.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
</br>To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
</br>And fall somewhat into a slower method,
</br>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
</br>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
</br>As blameful as the executioner?
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
</br>Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
</br>To undertake the death of all the world,
</br>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
</br>These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
</br>You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
</br>As all the world is cheered by the sun,
</br>So I by that; it is my day, my life.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>It is a quarrel most unnatural,
</br>To be revenged on him that loveth you.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
</br>To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
</br>Did it to help thee to a better husband.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>He lives that loves thee better than he could.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Name him.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Plantagenet.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Why, that was he.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Where is he?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Here.
</br>Why dost thou spit at me?
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Never came poison from so sweet a place.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
</br>Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I would they were, that I might die at once;
</br>For now they kill me with a living death.
</br>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
</br>Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
</br>These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
</br>No, when my father York and Edward wept,
</br>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
</br>When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
</br>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
</br>Told the sad story of my father's death,
</br>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
</br>That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
</br>Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
</br>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
</br>And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
</br>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
</br>I never sued to friend nor enemy;
</br>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
</br>But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
</br>My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
</br>Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
</br>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
</br>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
</br>Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
</br>Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
</br>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
</br>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
</br>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
</br>Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
</br>But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
</br>Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
</br>But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
</br>Take up the sword again, or take up me.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
</br>I will not be the executioner.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>I have already.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Tush, that was in thy rage:
</br>Speak it again, and, even with the word,
</br>That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
</br>Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
</br>To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>I would I knew thy heart.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>'Tis figured in my tongue.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>I fear me both are false.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Then never man was true.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Well, well, put up your sword.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Say, then, my peace is made.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>That shall you know hereafter.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>But shall I live in hope?
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>All men, I hope, live so.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>To take is not to give.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
</br>Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
</br>Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
</br>And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
</br>But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
</br>Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>What is it?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>That it would please thee leave these sad designs
</br>To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
</br>And presently repair to Crosby Place;
</br>Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
</br>At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
</br>And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
</br>I will with all expedient duty see you:
</br>For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
</br>Grant me this boon.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
</br>To see you are become so penitent.
</br>Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Bid me farewell.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>'Tis more than you deserve;
</br>But since you teach me how to flatter you,
</br>Imagine I have said farewell already.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Sirs, take up the corse.
</br>
</br>GENTLEMEN:
</br>Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
</br>Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
</br>Was ever woman in this humour won?
</br>I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
</br>What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
</br>To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
</br>With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
</br>The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
</br>Having God, her conscience, and these bars
</br>against me,
</br>And I nothing to back my suit at all,
</br>But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
</br>And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
</br>Ha!
</br>Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
</br>Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
</br>Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
</br>A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
</br>Framed in the prodigality of nature,
</br>Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
</br>The spacious world cannot again afford
</br>And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
</br>That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
</br>And made her widow to a woful bed?
</br>On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
</br>On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
</br>My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
</br>I do mistake my person all this while:
</br>Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
</br>Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
</br>I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
</br>And entertain some score or two of tailors,
</br>To study fashions to adorn my body:
</br>Since I am crept in favour with myself,
</br>Will maintain it with some little cost.
</br>But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
</br>And then return lamenting to my love.
</br>Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
</br>That I may see my shadow as I pass.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
</br>Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
</br>
</br>GREY:
</br>In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
</br>Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
</br>And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>If he were dead, what would betide of me?
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>No other harm but loss of such a lord.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
</br>
</br>GREY:
</br>The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
</br>To be your comforter when he is gone.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Oh, he is young and his minority
</br>Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
</br>A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>It is determined, not concluded yet:
</br>But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
</br>
</br>GREY:
</br>Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Good time of day unto your royal grace!
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
</br>To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
</br>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
</br>And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
</br>I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>I do beseech you, either not believe
</br>The envious slanders of her false accusers;
</br>Or, if she be accused in true report,
</br>Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
</br>From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
</br>Are come from visiting his majesty.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
</br>Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
</br>And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
</br>And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Would all were well! but that will never be
</br>I fear our happiness is at the highest.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
</br>Who are they that complain unto the king,
</br>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
</br>By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
</br>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
</br>Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
</br>Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
</br>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
</br>I must be held a rancorous enemy.
</br>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
</br>But thus his simple truth must be abused
</br>By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
</br>When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
</br>Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
</br>A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
</br>Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
</br>Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
</br>But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
</br>The king, of his own royal disposition,
</br>And not provoked by any suitor else;
</br>Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
</br>Which in your outward actions shows itself
</br>Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
</br>Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
</br>The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
</br>That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
</br>Since every Jack became a gentleman
</br>There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
</br>Gloucester;
</br>You envy my advancement and my friends':
</br>God grant we never may have need of you!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
</br>Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
</br>Myself disgraced, and the nobility
</br>Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
</br>Are daily given to ennoble those
</br>That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>By Him that raised me to this careful height
</br>From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
</br>I never did incense his majesty
</br>Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
</br>An earnest advocate to plead for him.
</br>My lord, you do me shameful injury,
</br>Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>You may deny that you were not the cause
</br>Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>She may, my lord, for--
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
</br>She may do more, sir, than denying that:
</br>She may help you to many fair preferments,
</br>And then deny her aiding hand therein,
</br>And lay those honours on your high deserts.
</br>What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>What, marry, may she?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
</br>A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
</br>I wis your grandam had a worser match.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
</br>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
</br>By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
</br>With those gross taunts I often have endured.
</br>I had rather be a country servant-maid
</br>Than a great queen, with this condition,
</br>To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
</br>Small joy have I in being England's queen.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
</br>Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>What! threat you me with telling of the king?
</br>Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
</br>I will avouch in presence of the king:
</br>I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
</br>'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Out, devil! I remember them too well:
</br>Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
</br>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
</br>I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
</br>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
</br>A liberal rewarder of his friends:
</br>To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>In all which time you and your husband Grey
</br>Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
</br>And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
</br>In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
</br>Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
</br>What you have been ere now, and what you are;
</br>Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
</br>Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Which God revenge!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
</br>And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
</br>I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
</br>Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
</br>I am too childish-foolish for this world.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
</br>Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
</br>Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
</br>We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
</br>So should we you, if you should be our king.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
</br>Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
</br>You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
</br>As little joy may you suppose in me.
</br>That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
</br>For I am she, and altogether joyless.
</br>I can no longer hold me patient.
</br>Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
</br>In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
</br>Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
</br>If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
</br>Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
</br>O gentle villain, do not turn away!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
</br>That will I make before I let thee go.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
</br>Than death can yield me here by my abode.
</br>A husband and a son thou owest to me;
</br>And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
</br>The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
</br>And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>The curse my noble father laid on thee,
</br>When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
</br>And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
</br>And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
</br>Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
</br>His curses, then from bitterness of soul
</br>Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
</br>And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>So just is God, to right the innocent.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
</br>And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>No man but prophesied revenge for it.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>What were you snarling all before I came,
</br>Ready to catch each other by the throat,
</br>And turn you all your hatred now on me?
</br>Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
</br>That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
</br>Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
</br>Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
</br>Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
</br>Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
</br>If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
</br>As ours by murder, to make him a king!
</br>Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
</br>For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
</br>Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
</br>Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
</br>Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
</br>Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
</br>And see another, as I see thee now,
</br>Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
</br>Long die thy happy days before thy death;
</br>And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
</br>Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
</br>Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
</br>And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
</br>Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
</br>That none of you may live your natural age,
</br>But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
</br>If heaven have any grievous plague in store
</br>Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
</br>O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
</br>And then hurl down their indignation
</br>On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
</br>The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
</br>Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
</br>And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
</br>No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
</br>Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
</br>Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
</br>Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
</br>Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
</br>The slave of nature and the son of hell!
</br>Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
</br>Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
</br>Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Margaret.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Richard!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Ha!
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>I call thee not.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
</br>That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
</br>O, let me make the period to my curse!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
</br>Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
</br>Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
</br>Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
</br>The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
</br>To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
</br>Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
</br>Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
</br>O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
</br>Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
</br>O, that your young nobility could judge
</br>What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
</br>They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
</br>And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
</br>Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
</br>And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
</br>Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
</br>Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
</br>Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
</br>Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
</br>O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
</br>As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
</br>Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
</br>And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
</br>My charity is outrage, life my shame
</br>And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Have done, have done.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
</br>In sign of league and amity with thee:
</br>Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
</br>Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
</br>Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Nor no one here; for curses never pass
</br>The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
</br>And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
</br>O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
</br>Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
</br>His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
</br>Have not to do with him, beware of him;
</br>Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
</br>And all their ministers attend on him.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
</br>And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
</br>O, but remember this another day,
</br>When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
</br>And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
</br>Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
</br>And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
</br>She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
</br>My part thereof that I have done to her.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>I never did her any, to my knowledge.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
</br>I was too hot to do somebody good,
</br>That is too cold in thinking of it now.
</br>Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
</br>He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
</br>God pardon them that are the cause of it!
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
</br>To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>So do I ever:
</br>being well-advised.
</br>For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
</br>And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Madam, we will attend your grace.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
</br>The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
</br>I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
</br>Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
</br>I do beweep to many simple gulls
</br>Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
</br>And say it is the queen and her allies
</br>That stir the king against the duke my brother.
</br>Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
</br>To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
</br>But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
</br>Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
</br>And thus I clothe my naked villany
</br>With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
</br>And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
</br>But, soft! here come my executioners.
</br>How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
</br>Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
</br>That we may be admitted where he is.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
</br>When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
</br>But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
</br>Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
</br>For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
</br>May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Tush!
</br>Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
</br>Talkers are no good doers: be assured
</br>We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
</br>I like you, lads; about your business straight;
</br>Go, go, dispatch.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>We will, my noble lord.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>Why looks your grace so heavily today?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
</br>So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
</br>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
</br>I would not spend another such a night,
</br>Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
</br>So full of dismal terror was the time!
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
</br>And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
</br>And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
</br>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
</br>Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
</br>And cited up a thousand fearful times,
</br>During the wars of York and Lancaster
</br>That had befall'n us. As we paced along
</br>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
</br>Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
</br>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
</br>Into the tumbling billows of the main.
</br>Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
</br>What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
</br>What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
</br>Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
</br>Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
</br>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
</br>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
</br>All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
</br>Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
</br>Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
</br>As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
</br>Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
</br>And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>Had you such leisure in the time of death
</br>To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Methought I had; and often did I strive
</br>To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
</br>Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
</br>To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
</br>But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
</br>Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>Awaked you not with this sore agony?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
</br>O, then began the tempest to my soul,
</br>Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
</br>With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
</br>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
</br>The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
</br>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
</br>Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
</br>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
</br>And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
</br>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
</br>Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
</br>'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
</br>That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
</br>Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
</br>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
</br>Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
</br>Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
</br>I trembling waked, and for a season after
</br>Could not believe but that I was in hell,
</br>Such terrible impression made the dream.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
</br>I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
</br>Which now bear evidence against my soul,
</br>For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
</br>O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
</br>But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
</br>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
</br>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
</br>I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
</br>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
</br>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
</br>Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
</br>Princes have but their tides for their glories,
</br>An outward honour for an inward toil;
</br>And, for unfelt imagination,
</br>They often feel a world of restless cares:
</br>So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
</br>There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Ho! who's here?
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>Yea, are you so brief?
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
</br>him our commission; talk no more.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>I am, in this, commanded to deliver
</br>The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
</br>I will not reason what is meant hereby,
</br>Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
</br>Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
</br>I'll to the king; and signify to him
</br>That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
</br>the judgment-day.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
</br>of remorse in me.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>What, art thou afraid?
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
</br>damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>I thought thou hadst been resolute.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>So I am, to let him live.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
</br>will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
</br>would tell twenty.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>How dost thou feel thyself now?
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
</br>within me.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Where is thy conscience now?
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
</br>thy conscience flies out.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>How if it come to thee again?
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
</br>makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
</br>accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
</br>he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
</br>detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
</br>mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
</br>obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
</br>that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
</br>is turned out of all towns and cities for a
</br>dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
</br>well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
</br>without it.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
</br>not to kill the duke.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
</br>would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
</br>I warrant thee.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
</br>reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
</br>sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
</br>in the next room.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>No, first let's reason with him.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
</br>
</br>Second murderer:
</br>You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>In God's name, what art thou?
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>A man, as you are.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>But not, as I am, royal.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Nor you, as we are, loyal.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
</br>Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
</br>Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
</br>
</br>Both:
</br>To, to, to--
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>To murder me?
</br>
</br>Both:
</br>Ay, ay.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
</br>And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
</br>Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Offended us you have not, but the king.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>I shall be reconciled to him again.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
</br>To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
</br>Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
</br>What lawful quest have given their verdict up
</br>Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
</br>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
</br>Before I be convict by course of law,
</br>To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
</br>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
</br>By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
</br>That you depart and lay no hands on me
</br>The deed you undertake is damnable.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>What we will do, we do upon command.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>And he that hath commanded is the king.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
</br>Hath in the tables of his law commanded
</br>That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
</br>Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
</br>Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
</br>To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
</br>For false forswearing and for murder too:
</br>Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
</br>To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>And, like a traitor to the name of God,
</br>Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
</br>Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
</br>When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
</br>For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
</br>He sends ye not to murder me for this
</br>For in this sin he is as deep as I.
</br>If God will be revenged for this deed.
</br>O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
</br>Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
</br>He needs no indirect nor lawless course
</br>To cut off those that have offended him.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
</br>When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
</br>That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
</br>Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
</br>I am his brother, and I love him well.
</br>If you be hired for meed, go back again,
</br>And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
</br>Who shall reward you better for my life
</br>Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
</br>Go you to him from me.
</br>
</br>Both:
</br>Ay, so we will.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Tell him, when that our princely father York
</br>Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
</br>And charged us from his soul to love each other,
</br>He little thought of this divided friendship:
</br>Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Right,
</br>As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
</br>'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
</br>He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
</br>That he would labour my delivery.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
</br>From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
</br>To counsel me to make my peace with God,
</br>And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
</br>That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
</br>Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
</br>To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>What shall we do?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Relent, and save your souls.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
</br>Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
</br>Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
</br>if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
</br>Would not entreat for life?
</br>My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
</br>O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
</br>Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
</br>As you would beg, were you in my distress
</br>A begging prince what beggar pities not?
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>Look behind you, my lord.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
</br>I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
</br>How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
</br>Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
</br>By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
</br>
</br>Second Murderer:
</br>I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
</br>Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
</br>For I repent me that the duke is slain.
</br>
</br>First Murderer:
</br>So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
</br>Now must I hide his body in some hole,
</br>Until the duke take order for his burial:
</br>And when I have my meed, I must away;
</br>For this will out, and here I must not stay.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
</br>You peers, continue this united league:
</br>I every day expect an embassage
</br>From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
</br>And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
</br>Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
</br>Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
</br>Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
</br>And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Take heed you dally not before your king;
</br>Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
</br>Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
</br>Either of you to be the other's end.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
</br>Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
</br>You have been factious one against the other,
</br>Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
</br>And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
</br>Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>This interchange of love, I here protest,
</br>Upon my part shall be unviolable.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>And so swear I, my lord
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
</br>With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
</br>And make me happy in your unity.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
</br>On you or yours,
</br>but with all duteous love
</br>Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
</br>With hate in those where I expect most love!
</br>When I have most need to employ a friend,
</br>And most assured that he is a friend
</br>Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
</br>Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
</br>When I am cold in zeal to yours.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
</br>is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
</br>There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
</br>To make the perfect period of this peace.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
</br>And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
</br>Brother, we done deeds of charity;
</br>Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
</br>Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
</br>Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
</br>By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
</br>Hold me a foe;
</br>If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
</br>Have aught committed that is hardly borne
</br>By any in this presence, I desire
</br>To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
</br>'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
</br>I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
</br>First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
</br>Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
</br>Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
</br>If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
</br>Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
</br>That without desert have frown'd on me;
</br>Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
</br>I do not know that Englishman alive
</br>With whom my soul is any jot at odds
</br>More than the infant that is born to-night
</br>I thank my God for my humility.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
</br>I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
</br>My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
</br>To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
</br>To be so bouted in this royal presence?
</br>Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
</br>You do him injury to scorn his corse.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
</br>But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
</br>And that a winged Mercury did bear:
</br>Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
</br>That came too lag to see him buried.
</br>God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
</br>Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
</br>Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
</br>And yet go current from suspicion!
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
</br>Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
</br>Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
</br>And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
</br>My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
</br>And yet his punishment was cruel death.
</br>Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
</br>Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
</br>Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
</br>Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
</br>The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
</br>Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
</br>When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
</br>And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
</br>Who told me, when we both lay in the field
</br>Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
</br>Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
</br>All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
</br>All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
</br>Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
</br>Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
</br>But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
</br>Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
</br>The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
</br>You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
</br>And I unjustly too, must grant it you
</br>But for my brother not a man would speak,
</br>Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
</br>For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
</br>Have been beholding to him in his life;
</br>Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
</br>O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
</br>On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
</br>Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
</br>Oh, poor Clarence!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
</br>How that the guilty kindred of the queen
</br>Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
</br>O, they did urge it still unto the king!
</br>God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
</br>To comfort Edward with our company.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>We wait upon your grace.
</br>
</br>Boy:
</br>Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>No, boy.
</br>
</br>Boy:
</br>Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
</br>And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
</br>
</br>Girl:
</br>Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
</br>And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
</br>If that our noble father be alive?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
</br>I do lament the sickness of the king.
</br>As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
</br>It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
</br>
</br>Boy:
</br>Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
</br>The king my uncle is to blame for this:
</br>God will revenge it; whom I will importune
</br>With daily prayers all to that effect.
</br>
</br>Girl:
</br>And so will I.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
</br>Incapable and shallow innocents,
</br>You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
</br>
</br>Boy:
</br>Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
</br>Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
</br>Devised impeachments to imprison him :
</br>And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
</br>And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
</br>Bade me rely on him as on my father,
</br>And he would love me dearly as his child.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
</br>And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
</br>He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
</br>Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
</br>
</br>Boy:
</br>Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Ay, boy.
</br>
</br>Boy:
</br>I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
</br>To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
</br>I'll join with black despair against my soul,
</br>And to myself become an enemy.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>What means this scene of rude impatience?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>To make an act of tragic violence:
</br>Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
</br>Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
</br>Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
</br>If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
</br>That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
</br>Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
</br>To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
</br>As I had title in thy noble husband!
</br>I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
</br>And lived by looking on his images:
</br>But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
</br>Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
</br>And I for comfort have but one false glass,
</br>Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
</br>Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
</br>And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
</br>But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
</br>And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
</br>Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
</br>Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
</br>To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
</br>
</br>Boy:
</br>Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
</br>How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
</br>
</br>Girl:
</br>Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
</br>Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Give me no help in lamentation;
</br>I am not barren to bring forth complaints
</br>All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
</br>That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
</br>May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
</br>Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
</br>
</br>Children:
</br>Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
</br>
</br>Children:
</br>What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Was never widow had so dear a loss!
</br>
</br>Children:
</br>Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Was never mother had so dear a loss!
</br>Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
</br>Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
</br>She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
</br>I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
</br>These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
</br>I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
</br>Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
</br>Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
</br>And I will pamper it with lamentations.
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
</br>That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
</br>In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
</br>With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
</br>Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
</br>Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
</br>For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
</br>Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
</br>Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
</br>Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
</br>And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
</br>To wail the dimming of our shining star;
</br>But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
</br>Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
</br>I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
</br>I crave your blessing.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
</br>Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
</br>That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
</br>Now cheer each other in each other's love
</br>Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
</br>We are to reap the harvest of his son.
</br>The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
</br>But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
</br>Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
</br>Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
</br>Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
</br>Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
</br>The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
</br>Which would be so much the more dangerous
</br>By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
</br>Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
</br>And may direct his course as please himself,
</br>As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
</br>In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I hope the king made peace with all of us
</br>And the compact is firm and true in me.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
</br>Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
</br>To no apparent likelihood of breach,
</br>Which haply by much company might be urged:
</br>Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
</br>That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>And so say I.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Then be it so; and go we to determine
</br>Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
</br>Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
</br>To give your censures in this weighty business?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>With all our harts.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
</br>For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
</br>For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
</br>As index to the story we late talk'd of,
</br>To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>My other self, my counsel's consistory,
</br>My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
</br>I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
</br>Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
</br>Hear you the news abroad?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Ay, that the king is dead.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
</br>I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Neighbours, God speed!
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Give you good morrow, sir.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>In him there is a hope of government,
</br>That in his nonage council under him,
</br>And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
</br>No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
</br>Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
</br>For then this land was famously enrich'd
</br>With politic grave counsel; then the king
</br>Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Better it were they all came by the father,
</br>Or by the father there were none at all;
</br>For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
</br>Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
</br>O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
</br>And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
</br>And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
</br>This sickly land might solace as before.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
</br>When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
</br>When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
</br>Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
</br>All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
</br>'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
</br>Ye cannot reason almost with a man
</br>That looks not heavily and full of fear.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>Before the times of change, still is it so:
</br>By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
</br>Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
</br>The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
</br>But leave it all to God. whither away?
</br>
</br>Second Citizen:
</br>Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
</br>
</br>Third Citizen:
</br>And so was I: I'll bear you company.
</br>
</br>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
</br>Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
</br>At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
</br>To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I long with all my heart to see the prince:
</br>I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>But I hear, no; they say my son of York
</br>Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
</br>My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
</br>More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
</br>Gloucester,
</br>'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
</br>And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
</br>Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
</br>In him that did object the same to thee;
</br>He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
</br>So long a-growing and so leisurely,
</br>That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
</br>
</br>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
</br>Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
</br>I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
</br>To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
</br>That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
</br>'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
</br>Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Grandam, his nurse.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
</br>
</br>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
</br>Good madam, be not angry with the child.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Pitchers have ears.
</br>
</br>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
</br>Here comes a messenger. What news?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>How fares the prince?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Well, madam, and in health.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>What is thy news then?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
</br>With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Who hath committed them?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>The mighty dukes
</br>Gloucester and Buckingham.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>For what offence?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
</br>Why or for what these nobles were committed
</br>Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
</br>The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
</br>Insulting tyranny begins to jet
</br>Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
</br>Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
</br>I see, as in a map, the end of all.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
</br>How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
</br>My husband lost his life to get the crown;
</br>And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
</br>For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
</br>And being seated, and domestic broils
</br>Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
</br>Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
</br>Self against self: O, preposterous
</br>And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
</br>Or let me die, to look on death no more!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
</br>Madam, farewell.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I'll go along with you.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>You have no cause.
</br>
</br>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
</br>My gracious lady, go;
</br>And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
</br>For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
</br>The seal I keep: and so betide to me
</br>As well I tender you and all of yours!
</br>Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
</br>The weary way hath made you melancholy.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
</br>Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
</br>I want more uncles here to welcome me.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
</br>Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
</br>Nor more can you distinguish of a man
</br>Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
</br>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
</br>Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
</br>Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
</br>But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
</br>God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>God bless your grace with health and happy days!
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
</br>I thought my mother, and my brother York,
</br>Would long ere this have met us on the way
</br>Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
</br>To tell us whether they will come or no!
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
</br>The queen your mother, and your brother York,
</br>Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
</br>Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
</br>But by his mother was perforce withheld.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
</br>Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
</br>Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
</br>Unto his princely brother presently?
</br>If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
</br>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
</br>
</br>CARDINAL:
</br>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
</br>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
</br>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
</br>To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
</br>We should infringe the holy privilege
</br>Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
</br>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
</br>Too ceremonious and traditional
</br>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
</br>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
</br>The benefit thereof is always granted
</br>To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
</br>And those who have the wit to claim the place:
</br>This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
</br>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
</br>Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
</br>You break no privilege nor charter there.
</br>Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
</br>But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
</br>
</br>CARDINAL:
</br>My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
</br>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>I go, my lord.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
</br>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
</br>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Where it seems best unto your royal self.
</br>If I may counsel you, some day or two
</br>Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
</br>Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
</br>For your best health and recreation.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>I do not like the Tower, of any place.
</br>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
</br>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Is it upon record, or else reported
</br>Successively from age to age, he built it?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Upon record, my gracious lord.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
</br>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
</br>As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
</br>Even to the general all-ending day.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>What say you, uncle?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I say, without characters, fame lives long.
</br>Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
</br>I moralize two meanings in one word.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
</br>With what his valour did enrich his wit,
</br>His wit set down to make his valour live
</br>Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
</br>For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
</br>I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>What, my gracious lord?
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>An if I live until I be a man,
</br>I'll win our ancient right in France again,
</br>Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
</br>Too late he died that might have kept that title,
</br>Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
</br>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
</br>The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>He hath, my lord.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>And therefore is he idle?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Then is he more beholding to you than I.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>He may command me as my sovereign;
</br>But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>A beggar, brother?
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
</br>And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
</br>In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>How?
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Little.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
</br>Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
</br>Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
</br>Because that I am little, like an ape,
</br>He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
</br>To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
</br>He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
</br>So cunning and so young is wonderful.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>My lord, will't please you pass along?
</br>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
</br>Will to your mother, to entreat of her
</br>To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>My lord protector needs will have it so.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Why, what should you fear?
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
</br>My grandam told me he was murdered there.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>I fear no uncles dead.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Nor none that live, I hope.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
</br>But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
</br>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Think you, my lord, this little prating York
</br>Was not incensed by his subtle mother
</br>To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
</br>Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
</br>He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
</br>Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
</br>As closely to conceal what we impart:
</br>Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
</br>What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
</br>To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
</br>For the instalment of this noble duke
</br>In the seat royal of this famous isle?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
</br>That he will not be won to aught against him.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
</br>And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
</br>How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
</br>And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
</br>To sit about the coronation.
</br>If thou dost find him tractable to us,
</br>Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
</br>If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
</br>Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
</br>And give us notice of his inclination:
</br>For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
</br>Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
</br>His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
</br>To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
</br>And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
</br>Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>You shall, my lord.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
</br>Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
</br>And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
</br>The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
</br>Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
</br>Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
</br>We may digest our complots in some form.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>What, ho! my lord!
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>What is't o'clock?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Upon the stroke of four.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>So it should seem by that I have to say.
</br>First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>And then?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>And then he sends you word
</br>He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
</br>Besides, he says there are two councils held;
</br>And that may be determined at the one
</br>which may make you and him to rue at the other.
</br>Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
</br>If presently you will take horse with him,
</br>And with all speed post with him toward the north,
</br>To shun the danger that his soul divines.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
</br>Bid him not fear the separated councils
</br>His honour and myself are at the one,
</br>And at the other is my servant Catesby
</br>Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
</br>Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
</br>Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
</br>And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
</br>To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
</br>To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
</br>Were to incense the boar to follow us
</br>And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
</br>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
</br>And we will both together to the Tower,
</br>Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Many good morrows to my noble lord!
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
</br>What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
</br>And I believe twill never stand upright
</br>Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Ay, my good lord.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
</br>Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
</br>But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
</br>Upon his party for the gain thereof:
</br>And thereupon he sends you this good news,
</br>That this same very day your enemies,
</br>The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
</br>Because they have been still mine enemies:
</br>But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
</br>To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
</br>God knows I will not do it, to the death.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
</br>That they who brought me in my master's hate
</br>I live to look upon their tragedy.
</br>I tell thee, Catesby--
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>What, my lord?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Ere a fortnight make me elder,
</br>I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
</br>When men are unprepared and look not for it.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
</br>With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
</br>With some men else, who think themselves as safe
</br>As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
</br>To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>The princes both make high account of you;
</br>For they account his head upon the bridge.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
</br>Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
</br>Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
</br>You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
</br>I do not like these several councils, I.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>My lord,
</br>I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
</br>And never in my life, I do protest,
</br>Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
</br>Think you, but that I know our state secure,
</br>I would be so triumphant as I am?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
</br>Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
</br>And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
</br>But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
</br>This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
</br>Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
</br>What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
</br>To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
</br>
</br>LORD STANLEY:
</br>They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
</br>Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
</br>But come, my lord, let us away.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
</br>How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
</br>
</br>Pursuivant:
</br>The better that your lordship please to ask.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
</br>Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
</br>Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
</br>By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
</br>But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
</br>This day those enemies are put to death,
</br>And I in better state than e'er I was.
</br>
</br>Pursuivant:
</br>God hold it, to your honour's good content!
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
</br>
</br>Pursuivant:
</br>God save your lordship!
</br>
</br>Priest:
</br>Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
</br>I am in your debt for your last exercise;
</br>Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
</br>Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
</br>Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
</br>Those men you talk of came into my mind.
</br>What, go you toward the Tower?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
</br>I shall return before your lordship thence.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>I'll wait upon your lordship.
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Come, bring forth the prisoners.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
</br>To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
</br>For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
</br>
</br>GREY:
</br>God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
</br>A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
</br>
</br>VAUGHAN:
</br>You live that shall cry woe for this after.
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
</br>Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
</br>Within the guilty closure of thy walls
</br>Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
</br>And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
</br>We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
</br>
</br>GREY:
</br>Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
</br>For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
</br>Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
</br>To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
</br>And for my sister and her princely sons,
</br>Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
</br>Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
</br>And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
</br>Is, to determine of the coronation.
</br>In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Are all things fitting for that royal time?
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>It is, and wants but nomination.
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF ELY:
</br>To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
</br>Who is most inward with the royal duke?
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF ELY:
</br>Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
</br>But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
</br>Than I of yours;
</br>Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
</br>Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
</br>But, for his purpose in the coronation.
</br>I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
</br>His gracious pleasure any way therein:
</br>But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
</br>And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
</br>Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF ELY:
</br>Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
</br>I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
</br>My absence doth neglect no great designs,
</br>Which by my presence might have been concluded.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
</br>William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
</br>I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
</br>His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>I thank your grace.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>My lord of Ely!
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF ELY:
</br>My lord?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>When I was last in Holborn,
</br>I saw good strawberries in your garden there
</br>I do beseech you send for some of them.
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF ELY:
</br>Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
</br>Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
</br>And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
</br>As he will lose his head ere give consent
</br>His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
</br>Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
</br>To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
</br>For I myself am not so well provided
</br>As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF ELY:
</br>Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
</br>strawberries.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
</br>There's some conceit or other likes him well,
</br>When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
</br>I think there's never a man in Christendom
</br>That can less hide his love or hate than he;
</br>For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>What of his heart perceive you in his face
</br>By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
</br>For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>I pray God he be not, I say.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
</br>That do conspire my death with devilish plots
</br>Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
</br>Upon my body with their hellish charms?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
</br>Makes me most forward in this noble presence
</br>To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
</br>I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
</br>See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
</br>Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
</br>And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
</br>Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
</br>That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
</br>Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
</br>Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
</br>I will not dine until I see the same.
</br>Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
</br>The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
</br>For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
</br>Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
</br>But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
</br>Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
</br>And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
</br>As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
</br>O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
</br>I now repent I told the pursuivant
</br>As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
</br>How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
</br>And I myself secure in grace and favour.
</br>O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
</br>Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
</br>Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>O momentary grace of mortal men,
</br>Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
</br>Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
</br>Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
</br>Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
</br>Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
</br>
</br>LOVEL:
</br>Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>O bloody Richard! miserable England!
</br>I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
</br>That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
</br>Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
</br>They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
</br>Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
</br>And then begin again, and stop again,
</br>As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
</br>Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
</br>Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
</br>Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
</br>Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
</br>And both are ready in their offices,
</br>At any time, to grace my stratagems.
</br>But what, is Catesby gone?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Lord mayor,--
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Look to the drawbridge there!
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Hark! a drum.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>God and our innocency defend and guard us!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
</br>
</br>LOVEL:
</br>Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
</br>The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
</br>I took him for the plainest harmless creature
</br>That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
</br>Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
</br>The history of all her secret thoughts:
</br>So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
</br>That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
</br>I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
</br>He lived from all attainder of suspect.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
</br>That ever lived.
</br>Would you imagine, or almost believe,
</br>Were't not that, by great preservation,
</br>We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
</br>This day had plotted, in the council-house
</br>To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>What, had he so?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
</br>Or that we would, against the form of law,
</br>Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
</br>But that the extreme peril of the case,
</br>The peace of England and our persons' safety,
</br>Enforced us to this execution?
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
</br>And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
</br>To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
</br>I never look'd for better at his hands,
</br>After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Yet had not we determined he should die,
</br>Until your lordship came to see his death;
</br>Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
</br>Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
</br>Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
</br>The traitor speak, and timorously confess
</br>The manner and the purpose of his treason;
</br>That you might well have signified the same
</br>Unto the citizens, who haply may
</br>Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
</br>As well as I had seen and heard him speak
</br>And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
</br>But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
</br>With all your just proceedings in this cause.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
</br>To avoid the carping censures of the world.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>But since you come too late of our intents,
</br>Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
</br>And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
</br>The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
</br>There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
</br>Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
</br>Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
</br>Only for saying he would make his son
</br>Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
</br>Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
</br>Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
</br>And bestial appetite in change of lust;
</br>Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
</br>Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
</br>Without control, listed to make his prey.
</br>Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
</br>Tell them, when that my mother went with child
</br>Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
</br>My princely father then had wars in France
</br>And, by just computation of the time,
</br>Found that the issue was not his begot;
</br>Which well appeared in his lineaments,
</br>Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
</br>But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
</br>Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
</br>As if the golden fee for which I plead
</br>Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
</br>Where you shall find me well accompanied
</br>With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>I go: and towards three or four o'clock
</br>Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
</br>Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
</br>Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
</br>Now will I in, to take some privy order,
</br>To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
</br>And to give notice, that no manner of person
</br>At any time have recourse unto the princes.
</br>
</br>Scrivener:
</br>This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
</br>Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
</br>That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
</br>And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
</br>Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
</br>For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
</br>The precedent was full as long a-doing:
</br>And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
</br>Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
</br>Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
</br>That seeth not this palpable device?
</br>Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
</br>Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
</br>When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
</br>The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
</br>And his contract by deputy in France;
</br>The insatiate greediness of his desires,
</br>And his enforcement of the city wives;
</br>His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
</br>As being got, your father then in France,
</br>His resemblance, being not like the duke;
</br>Withal I did infer your lineaments,
</br>Being the right idea of your father,
</br>Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
</br>Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
</br>Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
</br>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
</br>Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
</br>Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
</br>And when mine oratory grew to an end
</br>I bid them that did love their country's good
</br>Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Ah! and did they so?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
</br>But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
</br>Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
</br>Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
</br>And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
</br>His answer was, the people were not wont
</br>To be spoke to but by the recorder.
</br>Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
</br>'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
</br>But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
</br>When he had done, some followers of mine own,
</br>At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
</br>And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
</br>And thus I took the vantage of those few,
</br>'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
</br>'This general applause and loving shout
</br>Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
</br>And even here brake off, and came away.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>No, by my troth, my lord.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
</br>Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
</br>And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
</br>And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
</br>For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
</br>And be not easily won to our request:
</br>Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I go; and if you plead as well for them
</br>As I can say nay to thee for myself,
</br>No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
</br>Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
</br>I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
</br>Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
</br>What says he?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
</br>To visit him to-morrow or next day:
</br>He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
</br>Divinely bent to meditation;
</br>And no worldly suit would he be moved,
</br>To draw him from his holy exercise.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
</br>Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
</br>In deep designs and matters of great moment,
</br>No less importing than our general good,
</br>Are come to have some conference with his grace.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
</br>He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
</br>But on his knees at meditation;
</br>Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
</br>But meditating with two deep divines;
</br>Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
</br>But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
</br>Happy were England, would this gracious prince
</br>Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
</br>But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>I fear he will.
</br>How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>My lord,
</br>He wonders to what end you have assembled
</br>Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
</br>His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
</br>My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Sorry I am my noble cousin should
</br>Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
</br>By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
</br>And so once more return and tell his grace.
</br>When holy and devout religious men
</br>Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
</br>So sweet is zealous contemplation.
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>See, where he stands between two clergymen!
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
</br>To stay him from the fall of vanity:
</br>And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
</br>True ornaments to know a holy man.
</br>Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
</br>Lend favourable ears to our request;
</br>And pardon us the interruption
</br>Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>My lord, there needs no such apology:
</br>I rather do beseech you pardon me,
</br>Who, earnest in the service of my God,
</br>Neglect the visitation of my friends.
</br>But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
</br>And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I do suspect I have done some offence
</br>That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
</br>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
</br>At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Then know, it is your fault that you resign
</br>The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
</br>The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
</br>Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
</br>The lineal glory of your royal house,
</br>To the corruption of a blemished stock:
</br>Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
</br>Which here we waken to our country's good,
</br>This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
</br>Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
</br>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
</br>And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
</br>Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
</br>Which to recure, we heartily solicit
</br>Your gracious self to take on you the charge
</br>And kingly government of this your land,
</br>Not as protector, steward, substitute,
</br>Or lowly factor for another's gain;
</br>But as successively from blood to blood,
</br>Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
</br>For this, consorted with the citizens,
</br>Your very worshipful and loving friends,
</br>And by their vehement instigation,
</br>In this just suit come I to move your grace.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I know not whether to depart in silence,
</br>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
</br>Best fitteth my degree or your condition
</br>If not to answer, you might haply think
</br>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
</br>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
</br>Which fondly you would here impose on me;
</br>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
</br>So season'd with your faithful love to me.
</br>Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
</br>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
</br>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
</br>Definitively thus I answer you.
</br>Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
</br>Unmeritable shuns your high request.
</br>First if all obstacles were cut away,
</br>And that my path were even to the crown,
</br>As my ripe revenue and due by birth
</br>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
</br>So mighty and so many my defects,
</br>As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
</br>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
</br>Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
</br>And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
</br>But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
</br>And much I need to help you, if need were;
</br>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
</br>Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
</br>Will well become the seat of majesty,
</br>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
</br>On him I lay what you would lay on me,
</br>The right and fortune of his happy stars;
</br>Which God defend that I should wring from him!
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
</br>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
</br>All circumstances well considered.
</br>You say that Edward is your brother's son:
</br>So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
</br>For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
</br>Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
</br>And afterward by substitute betroth'd
</br>To Bona, sister to the King of France.
</br>These both put by a poor petitioner,
</br>A care-crazed mother of a many children,
</br>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
</br>Even in the afternoon of her best days,
</br>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
</br>Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
</br>To base declension and loathed bigamy
</br>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
</br>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
</br>More bitterly could I expostulate,
</br>Save that, for reverence to some alive,
</br>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
</br>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
</br>This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
</br>If non to bless us and the land withal,
</br>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
</br>From the corruption of abusing times,
</br>Unto a lineal true-derived course.
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
</br>I am unfit for state and majesty;
</br>I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
</br>I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
</br>Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
</br>As well we know your tenderness of heart
</br>And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
</br>Which we have noted in you to your kin,
</br>And egally indeed to all estates,--
</br>Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
</br>Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
</br>But we will plant some other in the throne,
</br>To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
</br>And in this resolution here we leave you.--
</br>Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
</br>
</br>ANOTHER:
</br>Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Would you enforce me to a world of care?
</br>Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
</br>But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
</br>Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
</br>Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
</br>Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
</br>To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
</br>I must have patience to endure the load:
</br>But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
</br>Attend the sequel of your imposition,
</br>Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
</br>From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
</br>For God he knows, and you may partly see,
</br>How far I am from the desire thereof.
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Then I salute you with this kingly title:
</br>Long live Richard, England's royal king!
</br>
</br>Lord Mayor:
</br>Amen.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Even when you please, since you will have it so.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
</br>And so most joyfully we take our leave.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Come, let us to our holy task again.
</br>Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
</br>Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
</br>Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
</br>On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
</br>Daughter, well met.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>God give your graces both
</br>A happy and a joyful time of day!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
</br>Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
</br>To gratulate the gentle princes there.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
</br>And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
</br>Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
</br>How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
</br>I may not suffer you to visit them;
</br>The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>The king! why, who's that?
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
</br>Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
</br>I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
</br>Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
</br>And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
</br>
</br>BRAKENBURY:
</br>No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
</br>I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
</br>
</br>LORD STANLEY:
</br>Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
</br>And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
</br>And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
</br>Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
</br>There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
</br>May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
</br>With this dead-killing news!
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
</br>
</br>DORSET:
</br>Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
</br>Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
</br>Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
</br>If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
</br>And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
</br>Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
</br>Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
</br>And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
</br>Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
</br>
</br>LORD STANLEY:
</br>Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
</br>Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
</br>You shall have letters from me to my son
</br>To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
</br>Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
</br>O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
</br>A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
</br>Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
</br>
</br>LORD STANLEY:
</br>Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>And I in all unwillingness will go.
</br>I would to God that the inclusive verge
</br>Of golden metal that must round my brow
</br>Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
</br>Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
</br>And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
</br>To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>No! why?  When he that is my husband now
</br>Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
</br>When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
</br>Which issued from my other angel husband
</br>And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
</br>O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
</br>This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
</br>For making me, so young, so old a widow!
</br>And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
</br>And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
</br>As miserable by the life of thee
</br>As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
</br>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
</br>Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
</br>Grossly grew captive to his honey words
</br>And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
</br>Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
</br>For never yet one hour in his bed
</br>Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
</br>But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
</br>Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
</br>And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
</br>
</br>LADY ANNE:
</br>Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
</br>Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
</br>Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
</br>Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
</br>Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
</br>For tender princes, use my babies well!
</br>So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>My gracious sovereign?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Give me thy hand.
</br>Thus high, by thy advice
</br>And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
</br>But shall we wear these honours for a day?
</br>Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Still live they and for ever may they last!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
</br>To try if thou be current gold indeed
</br>Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Say on, my loving lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>True, noble prince.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>O bitter consequence,
</br>That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
</br>Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
</br>Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
</br>And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
</br>What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Your grace may do your pleasure.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
</br>Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
</br>Before I positively herein:
</br>I will resolve your grace immediately.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>I will converse with iron-witted fools
</br>And unrespective boys: none are for me
</br>That look into me with considerate eyes:
</br>High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
</br>Boy!
</br>
</br>Page:
</br>My lord?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
</br>Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
</br>
</br>Page:
</br>My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
</br>Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
</br>Gold were as good as twenty orators,
</br>And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>What is his name?
</br>
</br>Page:
</br>His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
</br>The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
</br>No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
</br>Hath he so long held out with me untired,
</br>And stops he now for breath?
</br>How now! what news with you?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
</br>To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
</br>Where he abides.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Catesby!
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>My lord?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Rumour it abroad
</br>That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
</br>I will take order for her keeping close.
</br>Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
</br>Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
</br>The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
</br>Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
</br>That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
</br>About it; for it stands me much upon,
</br>To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
</br>I must be married to my brother's daughter,
</br>Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
</br>Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
</br>Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
</br>So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
</br>Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
</br>Is thy name Tyrrel?
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Art thou, indeed?
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>Ay, my lord;
</br>But I had rather kill two enemies.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
</br>Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
</br>Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
</br>Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>Let me have open means to come to them,
</br>And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
</br>Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
</br>There is no more but so: say it is done,
</br>And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>'Tis done, my gracious lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>Ye shall, my Lord.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
</br>The late demand that you did sound me in.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>I hear that news, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
</br>For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
</br>The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
</br>The which you promised I should possess.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
</br>Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>What says your highness to my just demand?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>As I remember, Henry the Sixth
</br>Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
</br>When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
</br>A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>My lord!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>How chance the prophet could not at that time
</br>Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
</br>The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
</br>And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
</br>Because a bard of Ireland told me once
</br>I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>My Lord!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Ay, what's o'clock?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
</br>Of what you promised me.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Well, but what's o'clock?
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Upon the stroke of ten.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Well, let it strike.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Why let it strike?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
</br>Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
</br>I am not in the giving vein to-day.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Tut, tut,
</br>Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Is it even so? rewards he my true service
</br>With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
</br>O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
</br>To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
</br>The most arch of piteous massacre
</br>That ever yet this land was guilty of.
</br>Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
</br>To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
</br>Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
</br>Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
</br>Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
</br>'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
</br>'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
</br>Within their innocent alabaster arms:
</br>Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
</br>Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
</br>A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
</br>Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
</br>But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
</br>Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
</br>The most replenished sweet work of nature,
</br>That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
</br>Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
</br>They could not speak; and so I left them both,
</br>To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
</br>And here he comes.
</br>All hail, my sovereign liege!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>If to have done the thing you gave in charge
</br>Beget your happiness, be happy then,
</br>For it is done, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>But didst thou see them dead?
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>I did, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
</br>
</br>TYRREL:
</br>The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
</br>But how or in what place I do not know.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
</br>And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
</br>Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
</br>And be inheritor of thy desire.
</br>Farewell till soon.
</br>The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
</br>His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
</br>The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
</br>And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
</br>Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
</br>At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
</br>And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
</br>To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>My lord!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
</br>And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
</br>Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
</br>Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
</br>Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
</br>Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
</br>Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
</br>Then fiery expedition be my wing,
</br>Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
</br>Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
</br>We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>So, now prosperity begins to mellow
</br>And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
</br>Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
</br>To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
</br>A dire induction am I witness to,
</br>And will to France, hoping the consequence
</br>Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
</br>Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
</br>My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
</br>If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
</br>And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
</br>Hover about me with your airy wings
</br>And hear your mother's lamentation!
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Hover about her; say, that right for right
</br>Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>So many miseries have crazed my voice,
</br>That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
</br>Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
</br>Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
</br>And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
</br>When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
</br>Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
</br>Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
</br>Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
</br>Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
</br>As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
</br>Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
</br>O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
</br>Give mine the benefit of seniory,
</br>And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
</br>If sorrow can admit society,
</br>Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
</br>I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
</br>I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
</br>Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
</br>Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
</br>I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
</br>From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
</br>A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
</br>That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
</br>To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
</br>That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
</br>That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
</br>That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
</br>Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
</br>O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
</br>How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
</br>Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
</br>And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
</br>God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
</br>And now I cloy me with beholding it.
</br>Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
</br>Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
</br>Young York he is but boot, because both they
</br>Match not the high perfection of my loss:
</br>Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
</br>And the beholders of this tragic play,
</br>The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
</br>Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
</br>Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
</br>Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
</br>And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
</br>Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
</br>Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
</br>To have him suddenly convey'd away.
</br>Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
</br>That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
</br>That I should wish for thee to help me curse
</br>That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
</br>I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
</br>The presentation of but what I was;
</br>The flattering index of a direful pageant;
</br>One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
</br>A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
</br>A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
</br>A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
</br>To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
</br>A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
</br>Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
</br>Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
</br>Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
</br>Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
</br>Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
</br>Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
</br>For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
</br>For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
</br>For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
</br>For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
</br>For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
</br>For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
</br>For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
</br>Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
</br>And left thee but a very prey to time;
</br>Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
</br>To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
</br>Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
</br>Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
</br>Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
</br>From which even here I slip my weary neck,
</br>And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
</br>Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
</br>These English woes will make me smile in France.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
</br>And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
</br>Compare dead happiness with living woe;
</br>Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
</br>And he that slew them fouler than he is:
</br>Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
</br>Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Why should calamity be full of words?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Windy attorneys to their client woes,
</br>Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
</br>Poor breathing orators of miseries!
</br>Let them have scope: though what they do impart
</br>Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
</br>And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
</br>My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
</br>I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Who intercepts my expedition?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>O, she that might have intercepted thee,
</br>By strangling thee in her accursed womb
</br>From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
</br>Where should be graven, if that right were right,
</br>The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
</br>And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
</br>Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
</br>And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
</br>Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
</br>Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
</br>Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
</br>Or with the clamorous report of war
</br>Thus will I drown your exclamations.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Art thou my son?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Then patiently hear my impatience.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
</br>Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>O, let me speak!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Do then: but I'll not hear.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
</br>God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>And came I not at last to comfort you?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
</br>Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
</br>A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
</br>Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
</br>Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
</br>Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
</br>Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
</br>treacherous,
</br>More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
</br>What comfortable hour canst thou name,
</br>That ever graced me in thy company?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
</br>your grace
</br>To breakfast once forth of my company.
</br>If I be so disgracious in your sight,
</br>Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
</br>Strike the drum.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I prithee, hear me speak.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>You speak too bitterly.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Hear me a word;
</br>For I shall never speak to thee again.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>So.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
</br>Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
</br>Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
</br>And never look upon thy face again.
</br>Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
</br>Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
</br>Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
</br>My prayers on the adverse party fight;
</br>And there the little souls of Edward's children
</br>Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
</br>And promise them success and victory.
</br>Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
</br>Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
</br>Abides in me; I say amen to all.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>I have no more sons of the royal blood
</br>For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
</br>They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
</br>And therefore level not to hit their lives.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
</br>Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>And must she die for this? O, let her live,
</br>And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
</br>Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
</br>Throw over her the veil of infamy:
</br>So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
</br>I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Her life is only safest in her birth.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>And only in that safety died her brothers.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
</br>My babes were destined to a fairer death,
</br>If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
</br>Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
</br>Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
</br>Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
</br>No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
</br>Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
</br>To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
</br>But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
</br>My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
</br>Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
</br>And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
</br>Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
</br>Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
</br>And dangerous success of bloody wars,
</br>As I intend more good to you and yours,
</br>Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
</br>To be discover'd, that can do me good?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>No, to the dignity and height of honour
</br>The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
</br>Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
</br>Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
</br>Will I withal endow a child of thine;
</br>So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
</br>Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
</br>Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
</br>Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>What do you think?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
</br>So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
</br>And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
</br>I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
</br>And mean to make her queen of England.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>What, thou?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>How canst thou woo her?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>That would I learn of you,
</br>As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>And wilt thou learn of me?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Madam, with all my heart.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
</br>A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
</br>Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
</br>Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
</br>Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
</br>A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
</br>The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
</br>And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
</br>If this inducement force her not to love,
</br>Send her a story of thy noble acts;
</br>Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
</br>Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
</br>Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
</br>To win our daughter.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>There is no other way
</br>Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
</br>And not be Richard that hath done all this.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Say that I did all this for love of her.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
</br>Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
</br>Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
</br>Which after hours give leisure to repent.
</br>If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
</br>To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
</br>If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
</br>To quicken your increase, I will beget
</br>Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
</br>A grandam's name is little less in love
</br>Than is the doting title of a mother;
</br>They are as children but one step below,
</br>Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
</br>Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
</br>Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
</br>Your children were vexation to your youth,
</br>But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
</br>The loss you have is but a son being king,
</br>And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
</br>I cannot make you what amends I would,
</br>Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
</br>Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
</br>Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
</br>This fair alliance quickly shall call home
</br>To high promotions and great dignity:
</br>The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
</br>Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
</br>Again shall you be mother to a king,
</br>And all the ruins of distressful times
</br>Repair'd with double riches of content.
</br>What! we have many goodly days to see:
</br>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
</br>Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
</br>Advantaging their loan with interest
</br>Of ten times double gain of happiness.
</br>Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
</br>Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
</br>Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
</br>Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
</br>Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
</br>With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
</br>And when this arm of mine hath chastised
</br>The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
</br>Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
</br>And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
</br>To whom I will retail my conquest won,
</br>And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>What were I best to say? her father's brother
</br>Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
</br>Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
</br>Under what title shall I woo for thee,
</br>That God, the law, my honour and her love,
</br>Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Say, I will love her everlastingly.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
</br>Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>I swear--
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>By nothing; for this is no oath:
</br>The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
</br>The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
</br>The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
</br>if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
</br>Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Now, by the world--
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>My father's death--
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Then, by myself--
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Thyself thyself misusest.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Why then, by God--
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>God's wrong is most of all.
</br>If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
</br>The unity the king thy brother made
</br>Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
</br>If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
</br>The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
</br>Had graced the tender temples of my child,
</br>And both the princes had been breathing here,
</br>Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
</br>Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
</br>What canst thou swear by now?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>The time to come.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
</br>For I myself have many tears to wash
</br>Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
</br>The children live, whose parents thou hast
</br>slaughter'd,
</br>Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
</br>The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
</br>Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
</br>Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
</br>Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>As I intend to prosper and repent,
</br>So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
</br>Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
</br>Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
</br>Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
</br>Be opposite all planets of good luck
</br>To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
</br>Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
</br>I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
</br>In her consists my happiness and thine;
</br>Without her, follows to this land and me,
</br>To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
</br>Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
</br>It cannot be avoided but by this;
</br>It will not be avoided but by this.
</br>Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
</br>Be the attorney of my love to her:
</br>Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
</br>Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
</br>Urge the necessity and state of times,
</br>And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Shall I forget myself to be myself?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>But thou didst kill my children.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
</br>Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
</br>Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>And be a happy mother by the deed.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>I go. Write to me very shortly.
</br>And you shall understand from me her mind.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
</br>Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
</br>How now! what news?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
</br>Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
</br>Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
</br>Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
</br>'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
</br>And there they hull, expecting but the aid
</br>Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
</br>Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Here, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Fly to the duke:
</br>Post thou to Salisbury
</br>When thou comest thither--
</br>Dull, unmindful villain,
</br>Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
</br>What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
</br>The greatest strength and power he can make,
</br>And meet me presently at Salisbury.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>I go.
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
</br>Salisbury?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Your highness told me I should post before.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
</br>How now, what news with you?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
</br>Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
</br>Why dost thou run so many mile about,
</br>When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
</br>Once more, what news?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>Richmond is on the seas.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
</br>White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
</br>He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
</br>Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
</br>What heir of York is there alive but we?
</br>And who is England's king but great York's heir?
</br>Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
</br>You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
</br>Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
</br>Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
</br>Are they not now upon the western shore.
</br>Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
</br>When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
</br>Please it your majesty to give me leave,
</br>I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
</br>Where and what time your majesty shall please.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
</br>I will not trust you, sir.
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>Most mighty sovereign,
</br>You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
</br>I never was nor never will be false.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Well,
</br>Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
</br>Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
</br>Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
</br>
</br>STANLEY:
</br>So deal with him as I prove true to you.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
</br>As I by friends am well advertised,
</br>Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
</br>Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
</br>With many more confederates, are in arms.
</br>
</br>Second Messenger:
</br>My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
</br>And every hour more competitors
</br>Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.
</br>
</br>Third Messenger:
</br>My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
</br>Take that, until thou bring me better news.
</br>
</br>Third Messenger:
</br>The news I have to tell your majesty
</br>Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
</br>Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
</br>And he himself wander'd away alone,
</br>No man knows whither.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>I cry thee mercy:
</br>There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
</br>Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
</br>Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
</br>
</br>Third Messenger:
</br>Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
</br>
</br>Fourth Messenger:
</br>Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
</br>'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
</br>Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
</br>The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
</br>Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
</br>Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
</br>If they were his assistants, yea or no;
</br>Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
</br>Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
</br>Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
</br>If not to fight with foreign enemies,
</br>Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
</br>That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
</br>Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
</br>Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
</br>A royal battle might be won and lost
</br>Some one take order Buckingham be brought
</br>To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
</br>That in the sty of this most bloody boar
</br>My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
</br>If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
</br>The fear of that withholds my present aid.
</br>But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
</br>
</br>CHRISTOPHER:
</br>At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>What men of name resort to him?
</br>
</br>CHRISTOPHER:
</br>Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
</br>Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
</br>Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
</br>And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
</br>And many more of noble fame and worth:
</br>And towards London they do bend their course,
</br>If by the way they be not fought withal.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
</br>Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
</br>He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
</br>These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
</br>
</br>Sheriff:
</br>No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
</br>Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
</br>Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
</br>By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
</br>If that your moody discontented souls
</br>Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
</br>Even for revenge mock my destruction!
</br>This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
</br>
</br>Sheriff:
</br>It is, my lord.
</br>
</br>BUCKINGHAM:
</br>Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
</br>This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
</br>I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
</br>False to his children or his wife's allies
</br>This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
</br>By the false faith of him I trusted most;
</br>This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
</br>Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
</br>That high All-Seer that I dallied with
</br>Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
</br>And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
</br>Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
</br>To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
</br>Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
</br>'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
</br>Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
</br>Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
</br>Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
</br>Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
</br>Thus far into the bowels of the land
</br>Have we march'd on without impediment;
</br>And here receive we from our father Stanley
</br>Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
</br>The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
</br>That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
</br>Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
</br>In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
</br>Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
</br>Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
</br>From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
</br>In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
</br>To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
</br>By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
</br>To fight against that bloody homicide.
</br>
</br>HERBERT:
</br>I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
</br>
</br>BLUNT:
</br>He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
</br>Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
</br>True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
</br>Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
</br>My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
</br>
</br>SURREY:
</br>My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>My Lord of Norfolk,--
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>Here, most gracious liege.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>We must both give and take, my gracious lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
</br>But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
</br>Who hath descried the number of the foe?
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Why, our battalion trebles that account:
</br>Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
</br>Which they upon the adverse party want.
</br>Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
</br>Let us survey the vantage of the field
</br>Call for some men of sound direction
</br>Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
</br>For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>The weary sun hath made a golden set,
</br>And by the bright track of his fiery car,
</br>Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
</br>Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
</br>Give me some ink and paper in my tent
</br>I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
</br>Limit each leader to his several charge,
</br>And part in just proportion our small strength.
</br>My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
</br>And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
</br>The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
</br>Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
</br>And by the second hour in the morning
</br>Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
</br>Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
</br>Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
</br>
</br>BLUNT:
</br>Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
</br>Which well I am assured I have not done,
</br>His regiment lies half a mile at least
</br>South from the mighty power of the king.
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>If without peril it be possible,
</br>Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
</br>And give him from me this most needful scroll.
</br>
</br>BLUNT:
</br>Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
</br>And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
</br>Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
</br>In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>What is't o'clock?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>It's supper-time, my lord;
</br>It's nine o'clock.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>I will not sup to-night.
</br>Give me some ink and paper.
</br>What, is my beaver easier than it was?
</br>And all my armour laid into my tent?
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
</br>Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>I go, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>I warrant you, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Catesby!
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>My lord?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Send out a pursuivant at arms
</br>To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
</br>Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
</br>Into the blind cave of eternal night.
</br>Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
</br>Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
</br>Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
</br>Ratcliff!
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>My lord?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
</br>Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
</br>Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
</br>I have not that alacrity of spirit,
</br>Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
</br>Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>It is, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Bid my guard watch; leave me.
</br>Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
</br>And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>All comfort that the dark night can afford
</br>Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
</br>Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
</br>Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
</br>So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
</br>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
</br>In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
</br>Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
</br>And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
</br>Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
</br>I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
</br>With best advantage will deceive the time,
</br>And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
</br>But on thy side I may not be too forward
</br>Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
</br>Be executed in his father's sight.
</br>Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
</br>Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
</br>And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
</br>Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
</br>God give us leisure for these rites of love!
</br>Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
</br>I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
</br>Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
</br>When I should mount with wings of victory:
</br>Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
</br>O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
</br>Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
</br>Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
</br>That they may crush down with a heavy fall
</br>The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
</br>Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
</br>That we may praise thee in the victory!
</br>To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
</br>Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
</br>Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
</br>
</br>Ghost of Prince Edward:
</br>
</br>Ghost of King Henry VI:
</br>
</br>Ghost of CLARENCE:
</br>
</br>Ghost of RIVERS:
</br>
</br>Ghost of GREY:
</br>
</br>Ghost of VAUGHAN:
</br>
</br>All:
</br>
</br>Ghost of HASTINGS:
</br>
</br>Ghosts of young Princes:
</br>
</br>Ghost of LADY ANNE:
</br>
</br>Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
</br>Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
</br>O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
</br>The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
</br>Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
</br>What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
</br>Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
</br>Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
</br>Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
</br>Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
</br>Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
</br>That I myself have done unto myself?
</br>O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
</br>For hateful deeds committed by myself!
</br>I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
</br>Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
</br>My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
</br>And every tongue brings in a several tale,
</br>And every tale condemns me for a villain.
</br>Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
</br>Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
</br>All several sins, all used in each degree,
</br>Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
</br>I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
</br>And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
</br>Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
</br>Find in myself no pity to myself?
</br>Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
</br>Came to my tent; and every one did threat
</br>To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>My lord!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>'Zounds! who is there?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
</br>Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
</br>Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
</br>What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>No doubt, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
</br>Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
</br>Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
</br>Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
</br>It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
</br>Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
</br>To see if any mean to shrink from me.
</br>
</br>LORDS:
</br>Good morrow, Richmond!
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
</br>That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
</br>
</br>LORDS:
</br>How have you slept, my lord?
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
</br>That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
</br>Have I since your departure had, my lords.
</br>Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
</br>Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
</br>I promise you, my soul is very jocund
</br>In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
</br>How far into the morning is it, lords?
</br>
</br>LORDS:
</br>Upon the stroke of four.
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
</br>More than I have said, loving countrymen,
</br>The leisure and enforcement of the time
</br>Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
</br>God and our good cause fight upon our side;
</br>The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
</br>Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
</br>Richard except, those whom we fight against
</br>Had rather have us win than him they follow:
</br>For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
</br>A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
</br>One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
</br>One that made means to come by what he hath,
</br>And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
</br>Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
</br>Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
</br>One that hath ever been God's enemy:
</br>Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
</br>God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
</br>If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
</br>You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
</br>If you do fight against your country's foes,
</br>Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
</br>If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
</br>Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
</br>If you do free your children from the sword,
</br>Your children's children quit it in your age.
</br>Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
</br>Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
</br>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
</br>Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
</br>But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
</br>The least of you shall share his part thereof.
</br>Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
</br>God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>That he was never trained up in arms.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
</br>Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
</br>Who saw the sun to-day?
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>Not I, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
</br>He should have braved the east an hour ago
</br>A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
</br>
</br>RATCLIFF:
</br>My lord?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>The sun will not be seen to-day;
</br>The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
</br>I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
</br>Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
</br>More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
</br>That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
</br>Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
</br>I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
</br>And thus my battle shall be ordered:
</br>My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
</br>Consisting equally of horse and foot;
</br>Our archers shall be placed in the midst
</br>John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
</br>Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
</br>They thus directed, we will follow
</br>In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
</br>Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
</br>This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>A good direction, warlike sovereign.
</br>This found I on my tent this morning.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>My lord, he doth deny to come.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Off with his son George's head!
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
</br>After the battle let George Stanley die.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
</br>Advance our standards, set upon our foes
</br>Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
</br>Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
</br>Upon them! victory sits on our helms.
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
</br>The king enacts more wonders than a man,
</br>Daring an opposite to every danger:
</br>His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
</br>Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
</br>Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
</br>
</br>CATESBY:
</br>Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD III:
</br>Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
</br>And I will stand the hazard of the die:
</br>I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
</br>Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
</br>A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
</br>The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
</br>Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
</br>From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
</br>Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
</br>Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
</br>But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
</br>Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>What men of name are slain on either side?
</br>
</br>DERBY:
</br>John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
</br>Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
</br>
</br>RICHMOND:
</br>Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
</br>Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
</br>That in submission will return to us:
</br>And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
</br>We will unite the white rose and the red:
</br>Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
</br>That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
</br>What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
</br>England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
</br>The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
</br>The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
</br>The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
</br>All this divided York and Lancaster,
</br>Divided in their dire division,
</br>O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
</br>The true succeeders of each royal house,
</br>By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
</br>And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
</br>Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
</br>With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
</br>Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
</br>That would reduce these bloody days again,
</br>And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
</br>Let them not live to taste this land's increase
</br>That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
</br>Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
</br>That she may long live here, God say amen!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
</br>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
</br>Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
</br>Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
</br>Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
</br>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>I have, my liege.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
</br>If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
</br>Or worthily, as a good subject should,
</br>On some known ground of treachery in him?
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>As near as I could sift him on that argument,
</br>On some apparent danger seen in him
</br>Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Then call them to our presence; face to face,
</br>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
</br>The accuser and the accused freely speak:
</br>High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
</br>In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Many years of happy days befal
</br>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>Each day still better other's happiness;
</br>Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
</br>Add an immortal title to your crown!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
</br>As well appeareth by the cause you come;
</br>Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
</br>Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
</br>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>First, heaven be the record to my speech!
</br>In the devotion of a subject's love,
</br>Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
</br>And free from other misbegotten hate,
</br>Come I appellant to this princely presence.
</br>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
</br>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
</br>My body shall make good upon this earth,
</br>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
</br>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
</br>Too good to be so and too bad to live,
</br>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
</br>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
</br>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
</br>With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
</br>And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
</br>What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
</br>'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
</br>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
</br>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
</br>The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
</br>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
</br>As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
</br>First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
</br>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
</br>Which else would post until it had return'd
</br>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
</br>Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
</br>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
</br>I do defy him, and I spit at him;
</br>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
</br>Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
</br>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
</br>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
</br>Or any other ground inhabitable,
</br>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
</br>Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
</br>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
</br>Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
</br>And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
</br>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
</br>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
</br>As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
</br>By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
</br>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
</br>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>I take it up; and by that sword I swear
</br>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
</br>I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
</br>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
</br>And when I mount, alive may I not light,
</br>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
</br>It must be great that can inherit us
</br>So much as of a thought of ill in him.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
</br>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
</br>In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
</br>The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
</br>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
</br>Besides I say and will in battle prove,
</br>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
</br>That ever was survey'd by English eye,
</br>That all the treasons for these eighteen years
</br>Complotted and contrived in this land
</br>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
</br>Further I say and further will maintain
</br>Upon his bad life to make all this good,
</br>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
</br>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
</br>And consequently, like a traitor coward,
</br>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
</br>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
</br>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
</br>To me for justice and rough chastisement;
</br>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
</br>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>How high a pitch his resolution soars!
</br>Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>O, let my sovereign turn away his face
</br>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
</br>Till I have told this slander of his blood,
</br>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
</br>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
</br>As he is but my father's brother's son,
</br>Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
</br>Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
</br>Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
</br>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
</br>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
</br>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
</br>Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
</br>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
</br>Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
</br>The other part reserved I by consent,
</br>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
</br>Upon remainder of a dear account,
</br>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
</br>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
</br>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
</br>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
</br>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
</br>The honourable father to my foe
</br>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
</br>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
</br>But ere I last received the sacrament
</br>I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
</br>Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
</br>This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
</br>It issues from the rancour of a villain,
</br>A recreant and most degenerate traitor
</br>Which in myself I boldly will defend;
</br>And interchangeably hurl down my gage
</br>Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
</br>To prove myself a loyal gentleman
</br>Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
</br>In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
</br>Your highness to assign our trial day.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
</br>Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
</br>This we prescribe, though no physician;
</br>Deep malice makes too deep incision;
</br>Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
</br>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
</br>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
</br>We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>To be a make-peace shall become my age:
</br>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>And, Norfolk, throw down his.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>When, Harry, when?
</br>Obedience bids I should not bid again.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
</br>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
</br>The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
</br>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
</br>To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
</br>I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
</br>Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
</br>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
</br>Which breathed this poison.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Rage must be withstood:
</br>Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
</br>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
</br>The purest treasure mortal times afford
</br>Is spotless reputation: that away,
</br>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
</br>A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
</br>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
</br>Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
</br>Take honour from me, and my life is done:
</br>Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
</br>In that I live and for that will I die.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
</br>Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
</br>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
</br>Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
</br>Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
</br>Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
</br>The slavish motive of recanting fear,
</br>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
</br>Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>We were not born to sue, but to command;
</br>Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
</br>Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
</br>At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
</br>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
</br>The swelling difference of your settled hate:
</br>Since we can not atone you, we shall see
</br>Justice design the victor's chivalry.
</br>Lord marshal, command our officers at arms
</br>Be ready to direct these home alarms.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
</br>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
</br>To stir against the butchers of his life!
</br>But since correction lieth in those hands
</br>Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
</br>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
</br>Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
</br>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS:
</br>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
</br>Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
</br>Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
</br>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
</br>Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
</br>Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
</br>Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
</br>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
</br>One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
</br>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
</br>Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
</br>Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
</br>By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
</br>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
</br>That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
</br>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
</br>Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
</br>In some large measure to thy father's death,
</br>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
</br>Who was the model of thy father's life.
</br>Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
</br>In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
</br>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
</br>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
</br>That which in mean men we intitle patience
</br>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
</br>What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
</br>The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
</br>His deputy anointed in His sight,
</br>Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
</br>Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
</br>An angry arm against His minister.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS:
</br>Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>To God, the widow's champion and defence.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS:
</br>Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
</br>Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
</br>Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
</br>O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
</br>That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
</br>Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
</br>Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
</br>They may break his foaming courser's back,
</br>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
</br>A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
</br>Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
</br>With her companion grief must end her life.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
</br>As much good stay with thee as go with me!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS:
</br>Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
</br>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
</br>I take my leave before I have begun,
</br>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
</br>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
</br>Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
</br>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
</br>I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
</br>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
</br>Alack, and what shall good old York there see
</br>But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
</br>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
</br>And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
</br>Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
</br>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
</br>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
</br>The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
</br>Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
</br>For nothing but his majesty's approach.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Marshal, demand of yonder champion
</br>The cause of his arrival here in arms:
</br>Ask him his name and orderly proceed
</br>To swear him in the justice of his cause.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
</br>And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
</br>Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:
</br>Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
</br>As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
</br>Who hither come engaged by my oath--
</br>Which God defend a knight should violate!--
</br>Both to defend my loyalty and truth
</br>To God, my king and my succeeding issue,
</br>Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
</br>And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
</br>To prove him, in defending of myself,
</br>A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
</br>And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
</br>Both who he is and why he cometh hither
</br>Thus plated in habiliments of war,
</br>And formally, according to our law,
</br>Depose him in the justice of his cause.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
</br>Before King Richard in his royal lists?
</br>Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
</br>Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
</br>Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
</br>To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
</br>In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
</br>That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
</br>To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
</br>And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>On pain of death, no person be so bold
</br>Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
</br>Except the marshal and such officers
</br>Appointed to direct these fair designs.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
</br>And bow my knee before his majesty:
</br>For Mowbray and myself are like two men
</br>That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
</br>Then let us take a ceremonious leave
</br>And loving farewell of our several friends.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>The appellant in all duty greets your highness,
</br>And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>We will descend and fold him in our arms.
</br>Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
</br>So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
</br>Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
</br>Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>O let no noble eye profane a tear
</br>For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
</br>As confident as is the falcon's flight
</br>Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
</br>My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
</br>Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
</br>Not sick, although I have to do with death,
</br>But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
</br>Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
</br>The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
</br>O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
</br>Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
</br>Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
</br>To reach at victory above my head,
</br>Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
</br>And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
</br>That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
</br>And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
</br>Even in the lusty havior of his son.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
</br>Be swift like lightning in the execution;
</br>And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
</br>Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
</br>Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
</br>Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>However God or fortune cast my lot,
</br>There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,
</br>A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
</br>Never did captive with a freer heart
</br>Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
</br>His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,
</br>More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
</br>This feast of battle with mine adversary.
</br>Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
</br>Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
</br>As gentle and as jocund as to jest
</br>Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Farewell, my lord: securely I espy
</br>Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
</br>Order the trial, marshal, and begin.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
</br>Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.
</br>
</br>First Herald:
</br>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
</br>Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
</br>On pain to be found false and recreant,
</br>To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
</br>A traitor to his God, his king and him;
</br>And dares him to set forward to the fight.
</br>
</br>Second Herald:
</br>Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
</br>On pain to be found false and recreant,
</br>Both to defend himself and to approve
</br>Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
</br>To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
</br>Courageously and with a free desire
</br>Attending but the signal to begin.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
</br>Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
</br>And both return back to their chairs again:
</br>Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
</br>While we return these dukes what we decree.
</br>Draw near,
</br>And list what with our council we have done.
</br>For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
</br>With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
</br>And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
</br>Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
</br>And for we think the eagle-winged pride
</br>Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
</br>With rival-hating envy, set on you
</br>To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
</br>Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
</br>Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
</br>With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
</br>And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
</br>Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
</br>And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,
</br>Therefore, we banish you our territories:
</br>You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
</br>Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
</br>Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
</br>But tread the stranger paths of banishment.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
</br>Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
</br>And those his golden beams to you here lent
</br>Shall point on me and gild my banishment.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
</br>Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
</br>The sly slow hours shall not determinate
</br>The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
</br>The hopeless word of 'never to return'
</br>Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
</br>And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
</br>A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
</br>As to be cast forth in the common air,
</br>Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
</br>The language I have learn'd these forty years,
</br>My native English, now I must forego:
</br>And now my tongue's use is to me no more
</br>Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
</br>Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
</br>Or, being open, put into his hands
</br>That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
</br>Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
</br>Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
</br>And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
</br>Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
</br>I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
</br>Too far in years to be a pupil now:
</br>What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
</br>Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>It boots thee not to be compassionate:
</br>After our sentence plaining comes too late.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
</br>To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Return again, and take an oath with thee.
</br>Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
</br>Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
</br>Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
</br>To keep the oath that we administer:
</br>You never shall, so help you truth and God!
</br>Embrace each other's love in banishment;
</br>Nor never look upon each other's face;
</br>Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
</br>This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
</br>Nor never by advised purpose meet
</br>To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
</br>'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>I swear.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>And I, to keep all this.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
</br>By this time, had the king permitted us,
</br>One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
</br>Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
</br>As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
</br>Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
</br>Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
</br>The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.
</br>
</br>THOMAS MOWBRAY:
</br>No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
</br>My name be blotted from the book of life,
</br>And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
</br>But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
</br>And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
</br>Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
</br>Save back to England, all the world's my way.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
</br>I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
</br>Hath from the number of his banish'd years
</br>Pluck'd four away.
</br>Six frozen winter spent,
</br>Return with welcome home from banishment.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>How long a time lies in one little word!
</br>Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
</br>End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>I thank my liege, that in regard of me
</br>He shortens four years of my son's exile:
</br>But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
</br>For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
</br>Can change their moons and bring their times about
</br>My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
</br>Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
</br>My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
</br>And blindfold death not let me see my son.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
</br>Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
</br>And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
</br>Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
</br>But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
</br>Thy word is current with him for my death,
</br>But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
</br>Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
</br>Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
</br>You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
</br>You would have bid me argue like a father.
</br>O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
</br>To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
</br>A partial slander sought I to avoid,
</br>And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
</br>Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
</br>I was too strict to make mine own away;
</br>But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
</br>Against my will to do myself this wrong.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
</br>Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
</br>From where you do remain let paper show.
</br>
</br>Lord Marshal:
</br>My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
</br>As far as land will let me, by your side.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
</br>That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>I have too few to take my leave of you,
</br>When the tongue's office should be prodigal
</br>To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>What is six winters? they are quickly gone.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
</br>Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>The sullen passage of thy weary steps
</br>Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
</br>The precious jewel of thy home return.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
</br>Will but remember me what a deal of world
</br>I wander from the jewels that I love.
</br>Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
</br>To foreign passages, and in the end,
</br>Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
</br>But that I was a journeyman to grief?
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>All places that the eye of heaven visits
</br>Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
</br>Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
</br>There is no virtue like necessity.
</br>Think not the king did banish thee,
</br>But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
</br>Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
</br>Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
</br>And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
</br>Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
</br>And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
</br>Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
</br>To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
</br>Suppose the singing birds musicians,
</br>The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
</br>The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
</br>Than a delightful measure or a dance;
</br>For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
</br>The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>O, who can hold a fire in his hand
</br>By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
</br>Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
</br>By bare imagination of a feast?
</br>Or wallow naked in December snow
</br>By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
</br>O, no! the apprehension of the good
</br>Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
</br>Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
</br>Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
</br>Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
</br>My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
</br>Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,
</br>Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
</br>How far brought you high Hereford on his way?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
</br>But to the next highway, and there I left him.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
</br>Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
</br>Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
</br>Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>What said our cousin when you parted with him?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>'Farewell:'
</br>And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
</br>Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
</br>To counterfeit oppression of such grief
</br>That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
</br>Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
</br>And added years to his short banishment,
</br>He should have had a volume of farewells;
</br>But since it would not, he had none of me.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
</br>When time shall call him home from banishment,
</br>Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
</br>Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
</br>Observed his courtship to the common people;
</br>How he did seem to dive into their hearts
</br>With humble and familiar courtesy,
</br>What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
</br>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
</br>And patient underbearing of his fortune,
</br>As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
</br>Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
</br>A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
</br>And had the tribute of his supple knee,
</br>With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
</br>As were our England in reversion his,
</br>And he our subjects' next degree in hope.
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
</br>Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
</br>Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
</br>Ere further leisure yield them further means
</br>For their advantage and your highness' loss.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>We will ourself in person to this war:
</br>And, for our coffers, with too great a court
</br>And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
</br>We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
</br>The revenue whereof shall furnish us
</br>For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
</br>Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
</br>Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
</br>They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
</br>And send them after to supply our wants;
</br>For we will make for Ireland presently.
</br>Bushy, what news?
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
</br>Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
</br>To entreat your majesty to visit him.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Where lies he?
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>At Ely House.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
</br>To help him to his grave immediately!
</br>The lining of his coffers shall make coats
</br>To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
</br>Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
</br>Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Amen.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
</br>In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
</br>For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>O, but they say the tongues of dying men
</br>Enforce attention like deep harmony:
</br>Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
</br>For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
</br>He that no more must say is listen'd more
</br>Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
</br>More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
</br>The setting sun, and music at the close,
</br>As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
</br>Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
</br>Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
</br>My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
</br>As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
</br>Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
</br>The open ear of youth doth always listen;
</br>Report of fashions in proud Italy,
</br>Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
</br>Limps after in base imitation.
</br>Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
</br>So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
</br>That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
</br>Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
</br>Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
</br>Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
</br>'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
</br>And thus expiring do foretell of him:
</br>His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
</br>For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
</br>Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
</br>He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
</br>With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
</br>Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
</br>Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
</br>This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
</br>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
</br>This other Eden, demi-paradise,
</br>This fortress built by Nature for herself
</br>Against infection and the hand of war,
</br>This happy breed of men, this little world,
</br>This precious stone set in the silver sea,
</br>Which serves it in the office of a wall,
</br>Or as a moat defensive to a house,
</br>Against the envy of less happier lands,
</br>This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
</br>This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
</br>Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
</br>Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
</br>For Christian service and true chivalry,
</br>As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
</br>Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
</br>This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
</br>Dear for her reputation through the world,
</br>Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
</br>Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
</br>England, bound in with the triumphant sea
</br>Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
</br>Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
</br>With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
</br>That England, that was wont to conquer others,
</br>Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
</br>Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
</br>How happy then were my ensuing death!
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
</br>For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>O how that name befits my composition!
</br>Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
</br>Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
</br>And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
</br>For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
</br>Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
</br>The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
</br>Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
</br>And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
</br>Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
</br>Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
</br>Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
</br>I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Should dying men flatter with those that live?
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>No, no, men living flatter those that die.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
</br>Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.
</br>Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
</br>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
</br>And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
</br>Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
</br>Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
</br>A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
</br>Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
</br>And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
</br>The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
</br>O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
</br>Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
</br>From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
</br>Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,
</br>Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.
</br>Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
</br>It were a shame to let this land by lease;
</br>But for thy world enjoying but this land,
</br>Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
</br>Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
</br>Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>A lunatic lean-witted fool,
</br>Presuming on an ague's privilege,
</br>Darest with thy frozen admonition
</br>Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
</br>With fury from his native residence.
</br>Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
</br>Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
</br>This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
</br>Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.
</br>
</br>JOHN OF GAUNT:
</br>O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
</br>For that I was his father Edward's son;
</br>That blood already, like the pelican,
</br>Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
</br>My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
</br>Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
</br>May be a precedent and witness good
</br>That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:
</br>Join with the present sickness that I have;
</br>And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
</br>To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.
</br>Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
</br>These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
</br>Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
</br>Love they to live that love and honour have.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>And let them die that age and sullens have;
</br>For both hast thou, and both become the grave.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
</br>To wayward sickliness and age in him:
</br>He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
</br>As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
</br>As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>What says he?
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Nay, nothing; all is said
</br>His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
</br>Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
</br>Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
</br>His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
</br>So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
</br>We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
</br>Which live like venom where no venom else
</br>But only they have privilege to live.
</br>And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
</br>Towards our assistance we do seize to us
</br>The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
</br>Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
</br>Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
</br>Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment
</br>Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
</br>Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
</br>About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
</br>Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
</br>Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
</br>I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
</br>Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
</br>In war was never lion raged more fierce,
</br>In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
</br>Than was that young and princely gentleman.
</br>His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
</br>Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
</br>But when he frown'd, it was against the French
</br>And not against his friends; his noble hand
</br>Did will what he did spend and spent not that
</br>Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
</br>His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
</br>But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
</br>O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
</br>Or else he never would compare between.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Why, uncle, what's the matter?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>O my liege,
</br>Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
</br>Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
</br>Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
</br>The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
</br>Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
</br>Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
</br>Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
</br>Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
</br>Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
</br>His charters and his customary rights;
</br>Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
</br>Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
</br>But by fair sequence and succession?
</br>Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
</br>If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
</br>Call in the letters patent that he hath
</br>By his attorneys-general to sue
</br>His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
</br>You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
</br>You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
</br>And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
</br>Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Think what you will, we seize into our hands
</br>His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
</br>What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
</br>But by bad courses may be understood
</br>That their events can never fall out good.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
</br>Bid him repair to us to Ely House
</br>To see this business. To-morrow next
</br>We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
</br>And we create, in absence of ourself,
</br>Our uncle York lord governor of England;
</br>For he is just and always loved us well.
</br>Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
</br>Be merry, for our time of stay is short
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>And living too; for now his son is duke.
</br>
</br>LORD WILLOUGHBY:
</br>Barely in title, not in revenue.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Richly in both, if justice had her right.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
</br>Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
</br>That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
</br>
</br>LORD WILLOUGHBY:
</br>Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
</br>If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
</br>Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>No good at all that I can do for him;
</br>Unless you call it good to pity him,
</br>Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
</br>In him, a royal prince, and many moe
</br>Of noble blood in this declining land.
</br>The king is not himself, but basely led
</br>By flatterers; and what they will inform,
</br>Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
</br>That will the king severely prosecute
</br>'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
</br>And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
</br>For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
</br>
</br>LORD WILLOUGHBY:
</br>And daily new exactions are devised,
</br>As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
</br>But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
</br>But basely yielded upon compromise
</br>That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
</br>More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
</br>
</br>LORD WILLOUGHBY:
</br>The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>He hath not money for these Irish wars,
</br>His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,
</br>But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
</br>But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
</br>Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
</br>We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
</br>And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
</br>And unavoided is the danger now,
</br>For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
</br>I spy life peering; but I dare not say
</br>How near the tidings of our comfort is.
</br>
</br>LORD WILLOUGHBY:
</br>Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
</br>We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
</br>Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
</br>In Brittany, received intelligence
</br>That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
</br>That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
</br>His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
</br>Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
</br>Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
</br>All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
</br>With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
</br>Are making hither with all due expedience
</br>And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
</br>Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
</br>The first departing of the king for Ireland.
</br>If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
</br>Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
</br>Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
</br>Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
</br>And make high majesty look like itself,
</br>Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
</br>But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
</br>Stay and be secret, and myself will go.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.
</br>
</br>LORD WILLOUGHBY:
</br>Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
</br>You promised, when you parted with the king,
</br>To lay aside life-harming heaviness
</br>And entertain a cheerful disposition.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>To please the king I did; to please myself
</br>I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
</br>Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
</br>Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
</br>As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
</br>Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
</br>Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
</br>With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
</br>More than with parting from my lord the king.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
</br>Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
</br>For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
</br>Divides one thing entire to many objects;
</br>Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
</br>Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
</br>Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
</br>Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
</br>Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
</br>Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
</br>Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
</br>More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
</br>Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
</br>Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>It may be so; but yet my inward soul
</br>Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
</br>I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
</br>As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
</br>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
</br>From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
</br>For nothing had begot my something grief;
</br>Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
</br>'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
</br>But what it is, that is not yet known; what
</br>I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
</br>I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
</br>For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
</br>Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
</br>And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
</br>Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
</br>The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
</br>And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
</br>At Ravenspurgh.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Now God in heaven forbid!
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
</br>The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
</br>The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
</br>With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
</br>And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
</br>Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
</br>And all the household servants fled with him
</br>To Bolingbroke.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
</br>And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
</br>Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
</br>And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
</br>Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>Despair not, madam.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Who shall hinder me?
</br>I will despair, and be at enmity
</br>With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
</br>A parasite, a keeper back of death,
</br>Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
</br>Which false hope lingers in extremity.
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>Here comes the Duke of York.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>With signs of war about his aged neck:
</br>O, full of careful business are his looks!
</br>Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
</br>Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
</br>Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
</br>Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
</br>Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
</br>Here am I left to underprop his land,
</br>Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
</br>Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
</br>Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>My lord, your son was gone before I came.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
</br>The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
</br>And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
</br>Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
</br>Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
</br>Hold, take my ring.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
</br>To-day, as I came by, I called there;
</br>But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>What is't, knave?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>An hour before I came, the duchess died.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
</br>Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
</br>I know not what to do: I would to God,
</br>So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
</br>The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
</br>What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
</br>How shall we do for money for these wars?
</br>Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
</br>Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
</br>And bring away the armour that is there.
</br>Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
</br>If I know how or which way to order these affairs
</br>Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
</br>Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
</br>The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
</br>And duty bids defend; the other again
</br>Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
</br>Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
</br>Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
</br>Dispose of you.
</br>Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
</br>And meet me presently at Berkeley.
</br>I should to Plashy too;
</br>But time will not permit: all is uneven,
</br>And every thing is left at six and seven.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
</br>But none returns. For us to levy power
</br>Proportionable to the enemy
</br>Is all unpossible.
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>Besides, our nearness to the king in love
</br>Is near the hate of those love not the king.
</br>
</br>BAGOT:
</br>And that's the wavering commons: for their love
</br>Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
</br>By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
</br>
</br>BAGOT:
</br>If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
</br>Because we ever have been near the king.
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
</br>The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>Thither will I with you; for little office
</br>The hateful commons will perform for us,
</br>Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
</br>Will you go along with us?
</br>
</br>BAGOT:
</br>No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
</br>Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
</br>We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
</br>Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
</br>Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
</br>Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>Well, we may meet again.
</br>
</br>BAGOT:
</br>I fear me, never.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Believe me, noble lord,
</br>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
</br>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
</br>Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
</br>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
</br>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
</br>But I bethink me what a weary way
</br>From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
</br>In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
</br>Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
</br>The tediousness and process of my travel:
</br>But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
</br>The present benefit which I possess;
</br>And hope to joy is little less in joy
</br>Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
</br>Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
</br>By sight of what I have, your noble company.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Of much less value is my company
</br>Than your good words. But who comes here?
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>It is my son, young Harry Percy,
</br>Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
</br>Harry, how fares your uncle?
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Why, is he not with the queen?
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
</br>Broken his staff of office and dispersed
</br>The household of the king.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>What was his reason?
</br>He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
</br>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
</br>To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
</br>And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
</br>What power the Duke of York had levied there;
</br>Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
</br>Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
</br>I never in my life did look on him.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
</br>Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
</br>Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
</br>To more approved service and desert.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
</br>I count myself in nothing else so happy
</br>As in a soul remembering my good friends;
</br>And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
</br>It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
</br>My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
</br>Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
</br>Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
</br>And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
</br>None else of name and noble estimate.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
</br>Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
</br>A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
</br>Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
</br>Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
</br>
</br>LORD WILLOUGHBY:
</br>And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
</br>Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
</br>Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
</br>
</br>LORD BERKELEY:
</br>My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
</br>And I am come to seek that name in England;
</br>And I must find that title in your tongue,
</br>Before I make reply to aught you say.
</br>
</br>LORD BERKELEY:
</br>Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
</br>To raze one title of your honour out:
</br>To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
</br>From the most gracious regent of this land,
</br>The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
</br>To take advantage of the absent time
</br>And fright our native peace with self-born arms.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>I shall not need transport my words by you;
</br>Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
</br>Whose duty is deceiveable and false.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>My gracious uncle--
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Tut, tut!
</br>Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
</br>I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
</br>In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
</br>Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
</br>Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
</br>But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
</br>So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
</br>Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
</br>And ostentation of despised arms?
</br>Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
</br>Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
</br>And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
</br>Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
</br>As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
</br>Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
</br>From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
</br>O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
</br>Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
</br>And minister correction to thy fault!
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
</br>On what condition stands it and wherein?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Even in condition of the worst degree,
</br>In gross rebellion and detested treason:
</br>Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
</br>Before the expiration of thy time,
</br>In braving arms against thy sovereign.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
</br>But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
</br>And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
</br>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
</br>You are my father, for methinks in you
</br>I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
</br>Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
</br>A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
</br>Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
</br>To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
</br>If that my cousin king be King of England,
</br>It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
</br>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
</br>Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
</br>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
</br>To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
</br>I am denied to sue my livery here,
</br>And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
</br>My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
</br>And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
</br>What would you have me do? I am a subject,
</br>And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
</br>And therefore, personally I lay my claim
</br>To my inheritance of free descent.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>The noble duke hath been too much abused.
</br>
</br>LORD ROSS:
</br>It stands your grace upon to do him right.
</br>
</br>LORD WILLOUGHBY:
</br>Base men by his endowments are made great.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>My lords of England, let me tell you this:
</br>I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
</br>And laboured all I could to do him right;
</br>But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
</br>Be his own carver and cut out his way,
</br>To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
</br>And you that do abet him in this kind
</br>Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
</br>But for his own; and for the right of that
</br>We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
</br>And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
</br>I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
</br>Because my power is weak and all ill left:
</br>But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
</br>I would attach you all and make you stoop
</br>Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
</br>But since I cannot, be it known to you
</br>I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
</br>Unless you please to enter in the castle
</br>And there repose you for this night.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
</br>But we must win your grace to go with us
</br>To Bristol castle, which they say is held
</br>By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
</br>The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
</br>Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
</br>For I am loath to break our country's laws.
</br>Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
</br>Things past redress are now with me past care.
</br>
</br>Captain:
</br>My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
</br>And hardly kept our countrymen together,
</br>And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
</br>Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.
</br>
</br>EARL OF SALISBURY:
</br>Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
</br>The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.
</br>
</br>Captain:
</br>'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
</br>The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
</br>And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
</br>The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
</br>And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
</br>Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
</br>The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
</br>The other to enjoy by rage and war:
</br>These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
</br>Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
</br>As well assured Richard their king is dead.
</br>
</br>EARL OF SALISBURY:
</br>Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
</br>I see thy glory like a shooting star
</br>Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
</br>Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
</br>Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
</br>Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
</br>And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Bring forth these men.
</br>Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
</br>Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
</br>With too much urging your pernicious lives,
</br>For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
</br>From off my hands, here in the view of men
</br>I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
</br>You have misled a prince, a royal king,
</br>A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
</br>By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
</br>You have in manner with your sinful hours
</br>Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
</br>Broke the possession of a royal bed
</br>And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
</br>With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
</br>Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
</br>Near to the king in blood, and near in love
</br>Till you did make him misinterpret me,
</br>Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
</br>And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
</br>Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
</br>Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
</br>Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
</br>From my own windows torn my household coat,
</br>Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
</br>Save men's opinions and my living blood,
</br>To show the world I am a gentleman.
</br>This and much more, much more than twice all this,
</br>Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
</br>To execution and the hand of death.
</br>
</br>BUSHY:
</br>More welcome is the stroke of death to me
</br>Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.
</br>
</br>GREEN:
</br>My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
</br>And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
</br>Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
</br>For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
</br>Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
</br>Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
</br>With letters of your love to her at large.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
</br>To fight with Glendower and his complices:
</br>Awhile to work, and after holiday.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
</br>After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
</br>To stand upon my kingdom once again.
</br>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
</br>Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
</br>As a long-parted mother with her child
</br>Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
</br>So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
</br>And do thee favours with my royal hands.
</br>Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
</br>Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
</br>But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
</br>And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
</br>Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
</br>Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
</br>Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
</br>And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
</br>Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
</br>Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
</br>Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
</br>Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
</br>This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
</br>Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
</br>Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
</br>Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
</br>Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
</br>The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
</br>And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
</br>And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
</br>The proffer'd means of succor and redress.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
</br>Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
</br>Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
</br>That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
</br>Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
</br>Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
</br>In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
</br>But when from under this terrestrial ball
</br>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
</br>And darts his light through every guilty hole,
</br>Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
</br>The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
</br>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
</br>So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
</br>Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
</br>Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
</br>Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
</br>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
</br>Not able to endure the sight of day,
</br>But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
</br>Not all the water in the rough rude sea
</br>Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
</br>The breath of worldly men cannot depose
</br>The deputy elected by the Lord:
</br>For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
</br>To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
</br>God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
</br>A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
</br>Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
</br>Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?
</br>
</br>EARL OF SALISBURY:
</br>Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
</br>Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
</br>And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
</br>One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
</br>Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
</br>O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
</br>And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
</br>To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
</br>O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
</br>For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
</br>Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>But now the blood of twenty thousand men
</br>Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
</br>And, till so much blood thither come again,
</br>Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
</br>All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
</br>For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>I had forgot myself; am I not king?
</br>Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
</br>Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
</br>Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
</br>At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
</br>Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
</br>High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
</br>Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
</br>
</br>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
</br>More health and happiness betide my liege
</br>Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
</br>The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
</br>Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
</br>And what loss is it to be rid of care?
</br>Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
</br>Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
</br>We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
</br>Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
</br>They break their faith to God as well as us:
</br>Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
</br>The worst is death, and death will have his day.
</br>
</br>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
</br>Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
</br>To bear the tidings of calamity.
</br>Like an unseasonable stormy day,
</br>Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
</br>As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
</br>So high above his limits swells the rage
</br>Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
</br>With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
</br>White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
</br>Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
</br>Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
</br>In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
</br>The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
</br>Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
</br>Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
</br>Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
</br>And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
</br>Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
</br>What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
</br>That they have let the dangerous enemy
</br>Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
</br>If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
</br>I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.
</br>
</br>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
</br>Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
</br>Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
</br>Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
</br>Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
</br>Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
</br>Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
</br>
</br>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
</br>Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
</br>Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
</br>Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
</br>With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
</br>Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
</br>And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
</br>
</br>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
</br>Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Where is the duke my father with his power?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
</br>Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
</br>Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
</br>Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
</br>Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
</br>And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
</br>Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
</br>Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
</br>And nothing can we call our own but death
</br>And that small model of the barren earth
</br>Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
</br>For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
</br>And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
</br>How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
</br>Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
</br>Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
</br>All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
</br>That rounds the mortal temples of a king
</br>Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
</br>Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
</br>Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
</br>To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
</br>Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
</br>As if this flesh which walls about our life,
</br>Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
</br>Comes at the last and with a little pin
</br>Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
</br>Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
</br>With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
</br>Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
</br>For you have but mistook me all this while:
</br>I live with bread like you, feel want,
</br>Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
</br>How can you say to me, I am a king?
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
</br>My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
</br>But presently prevent the ways to wail.
</br>To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
</br>Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
</br>And so your follies fight against yourself.
</br>Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
</br>And fight and die is death destroying death;
</br>Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>My father hath a power; inquire of him
</br>And learn to make a body of a limb.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
</br>To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
</br>This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
</br>An easy task it is to win our own.
</br>Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
</br>Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.
</br>
</br>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
</br>Men judge by the complexion of the sky
</br>The state and inclination of the day:
</br>So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
</br>My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
</br>I play the torturer, by small and small
</br>To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
</br>Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
</br>And all your northern castles yielded up,
</br>And all your southern gentlemen in arms
</br>Upon his party.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Thou hast said enough.
</br>Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
</br>Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
</br>What say you now? what comfort have we now?
</br>By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
</br>That bids me be of comfort any more.
</br>Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
</br>A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
</br>That power I have, discharge; and let them go
</br>To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
</br>For I have none: let no man speak again
</br>To alter this, for counsel is but vain.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>My liege, one word.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>He does me double wrong
</br>That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
</br>Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
</br>From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>So that by this intelligence we learn
</br>The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
</br>Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
</br>With some few private friends upon this coast.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>The news is very fair and good, my lord:
</br>Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
</br>To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
</br>When such a sacred king should hide his head.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
</br>Left I his title out.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>The time hath been,
</br>Would you have been so brief with him, he would
</br>Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,
</br>For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
</br>Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
</br>Against their will. But who comes here?
</br>Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
</br>Against thy entrance.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Royally!
</br>Why, it contains no king?
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>Yes, my good lord,
</br>It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
</br>Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
</br>And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
</br>Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
</br>Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Noble lords,
</br>Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
</br>Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
</br>Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
</br>Henry Bolingbroke
</br>On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
</br>And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
</br>To his most royal person, hither come
</br>Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
</br>Provided that my banishment repeal'd
</br>And lands restored again be freely granted:
</br>If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
</br>And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
</br>Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
</br>The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
</br>It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
</br>The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
</br>My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
</br>Go, signify as much, while here we march
</br>Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
</br>Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,
</br>That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
</br>Our fair appointments may be well perused.
</br>Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
</br>With no less terror than the elements
</br>Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
</br>At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
</br>Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
</br>The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
</br>My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
</br>March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
</br>See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
</br>As doth the blushing discontented sun
</br>From out the fiery portal of the east,
</br>When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
</br>To dim his glory and to stain the track
</br>Of his bright passage to the occident.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
</br>As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
</br>Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
</br>That any harm should stain so fair a show!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
</br>To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
</br>Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
</br>And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
</br>To pay their awful duty to our presence?
</br>If we be not, show us the hand of God
</br>That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
</br>For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
</br>Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
</br>Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
</br>And though you think that all, as you have done,
</br>Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
</br>And we are barren and bereft of friends;
</br>Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
</br>Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
</br>Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
</br>Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
</br>That lift your vassal hands against my head
</br>And threat the glory of my precious crown.
</br>Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
</br>That every stride he makes upon my land
</br>Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
</br>The purple testament of bleeding war;
</br>But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
</br>Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
</br>Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
</br>Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
</br>To scarlet indignation and bedew
</br>Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
</br>Should so with civil and uncivil arms
</br>Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
</br>Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
</br>And by the honourable tomb he swears,
</br>That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
</br>And by the royalties of both your bloods,
</br>Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
</br>And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
</br>And by the worth and honour of himself,
</br>Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
</br>His coming hither hath no further scope
</br>Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
</br>Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
</br>Which on thy royal party granted once,
</br>His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
</br>His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
</br>To faithful service of your majesty.
</br>This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
</br>And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
</br>His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
</br>And all the number of his fair demands
</br>Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
</br>With all the gracious utterance thou hast
</br>Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
</br>We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
</br>To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
</br>Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
</br>Defiance to the traitor, and so die?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
</br>Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
</br>That laid the sentence of dread banishment
</br>On yon proud man, should take it off again
</br>With words of sooth! O that I were as great
</br>As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
</br>Or that I could forget what I have been,
</br>Or not remember what I must be now!
</br>Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
</br>Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>What must the king do now? must he submit?
</br>The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
</br>The king shall be contented: must he lose
</br>The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:
</br>I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
</br>My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
</br>My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
</br>My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
</br>My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
</br>My subjects for a pair of carved saints
</br>And my large kingdom for a little grave,
</br>A little little grave, an obscure grave;
</br>Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
</br>Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
</br>May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
</br>For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
</br>And buried once, why not upon my head?
</br>Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
</br>We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
</br>Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
</br>And make a dearth in this revolting land.
</br>Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
</br>And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
</br>As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
</br>Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
</br>Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
</br>Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
</br>Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
</br>I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
</br>Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
</br>What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
</br>Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
</br>You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>My lord, in the base court he doth attend
</br>To speak with you; may it please you to come down.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
</br>Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
</br>In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
</br>To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
</br>In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
</br>down, king!
</br>For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
</br>should sing.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>What says his majesty?
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Sorrow and grief of heart
</br>Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
</br>Yet he is come.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Stand all apart,
</br>And show fair duty to his majesty.
</br>My gracious lord,--
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
</br>To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
</br>Me rather had my heart might feel your love
</br>Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
</br>Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
</br>Thus high at least, although your knee be low.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
</br>As my true service shall deserve your love.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
</br>That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
</br>Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
</br>Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
</br>Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
</br>Though you are old enough to be my heir.
</br>What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
</br>For do we must what force will have us do.
</br>Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Yea, my good lord.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Then I must not say no.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
</br>To drive away the heavy thought of care?
</br>
</br>Lady:
</br>Madam, we'll play at bowls.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
</br>And that my fortune rubs against the bias.
</br>
</br>Lady:
</br>Madam, we'll dance.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>My legs can keep no measure in delight,
</br>When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
</br>Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.
</br>
</br>Lady:
</br>Madam, we'll tell tales.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Of sorrow or of joy?
</br>
</br>Lady:
</br>Of either, madam.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Of neither, girl:
</br>For of joy, being altogether wanting,
</br>It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
</br>Or if of grief, being altogether had,
</br>It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
</br>For what I have I need not to repeat;
</br>And what I want it boots not to complain.
</br>
</br>Lady:
</br>Madam, I'll sing.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>'Tis well that thou hast cause
</br>But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.
</br>
</br>Lady:
</br>I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
</br>And never borrow any tear of thee.
</br>But stay, here come the gardeners:
</br>Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
</br>My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
</br>They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
</br>Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.
</br>
</br>Gardener:
</br>Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
</br>Which, like unruly children, make their sire
</br>Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
</br>Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
</br>Go thou, and like an executioner,
</br>Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
</br>That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
</br>All must be even in our government.
</br>You thus employ'd, I will go root away
</br>The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
</br>The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Why should we in the compass of a pale
</br>Keep law and form and due proportion,
</br>Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
</br>When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
</br>Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
</br>Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
</br>Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
</br>Swarming with caterpillars?
</br>
</br>Gardener:
</br>Hold thy peace:
</br>He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
</br>Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
</br>The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
</br>That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
</br>Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
</br>I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>What, are they dead?
</br>
</br>Gardener:
</br>They are; and Bolingbroke
</br>Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
</br>That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
</br>As we this garden! We at time of year
</br>Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
</br>Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
</br>With too much riches it confound itself:
</br>Had he done so to great and growing men,
</br>They might have lived to bear and he to taste
</br>Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
</br>We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
</br>Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
</br>Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>What, think you then the king shall be deposed?
</br>
</br>Gardener:
</br>Depress'd he is already, and deposed
</br>'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
</br>To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
</br>That tell black tidings.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
</br>Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
</br>How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
</br>What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
</br>To make a second fall of cursed man?
</br>Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
</br>Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
</br>Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
</br>Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.
</br>
</br>Gardener:
</br>Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
</br>To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
</br>King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
</br>Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
</br>In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
</br>And some few vanities that make him light;
</br>But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
</br>Besides himself, are all the English peers,
</br>And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
</br>Post you to London, and you will find it so;
</br>I speak no more than every one doth know.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
</br>Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
</br>And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st
</br>To serve me last, that I may longest keep
</br>Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
</br>To meet at London London's king in woe.
</br>What, was I born to this, that my sad look
</br>Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
</br>Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
</br>Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.
</br>
</br>GARDENER:
</br>Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
</br>I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
</br>Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
</br>I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
</br>Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
</br>In the remembrance of a weeping queen.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Call forth Bagot.
</br>Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
</br>What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
</br>Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
</br>The bloody office of his timeless end.
</br>
</br>BAGOT:
</br>Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
</br>
</br>BAGOT:
</br>My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
</br>Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
</br>In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
</br>I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
</br>That reacheth from the restful English court
</br>As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
</br>Amongst much other talk, that very time,
</br>I heard you say that you had rather refuse
</br>The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
</br>Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
</br>Adding withal how blest this land would be
</br>In this your cousin's death.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Princes and noble lords,
</br>What answer shall I make to this base man?
</br>Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
</br>On equal terms to give him chastisement?
</br>Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
</br>With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
</br>There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
</br>That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
</br>And will maintain what thou hast said is false
</br>In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
</br>To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Excepting one, I would he were the best
</br>In all this presence that hath moved me so.
</br>
</br>LORD FITZWATER:
</br>If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
</br>There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
</br>By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
</br>I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
</br>That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
</br>If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
</br>And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
</br>Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
</br>
</br>LORD FITZWATER:
</br>Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
</br>In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
</br>And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
</br>To prove it on thee to the extremest point
</br>Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>An if I do not, may my hands rot off
</br>And never brandish more revengeful steel
</br>Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
</br>
</br>Lord:
</br>I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
</br>And spur thee on with full as many lies
</br>As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
</br>From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
</br>Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
</br>I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
</br>To answer twenty thousand such as you.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF SURREY:
</br>My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
</br>The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
</br>
</br>LORD FITZWATER:
</br>'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
</br>And you can witness with me this is true.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF SURREY:
</br>As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
</br>
</br>LORD FITZWATER:
</br>Surrey, thou liest.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF SURREY:
</br>Dishonourable boy!
</br>That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
</br>That it shall render vengeance and revenge
</br>Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
</br>In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
</br>In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
</br>Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
</br>
</br>LORD FITZWATER:
</br>How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
</br>If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
</br>I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
</br>And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,
</br>And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,
</br>To tie thee to my strong correction.
</br>As I intend to thrive in this new world,
</br>Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
</br>Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
</br>That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
</br>To execute the noble duke at Calais.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
</br>That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
</br>If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>These differences shall all rest under gage
</br>Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
</br>And, though mine enemy, restored again
</br>To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
</br>Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
</br>That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
</br>Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
</br>For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
</br>Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
</br>Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
</br>And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
</br>To Italy; and there at Venice gave
</br>His body to that pleasant country's earth,
</br>And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
</br>Under whose colours he had fought so long.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
</br>As surely as I live, my lord.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
</br>Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
</br>Your differences shall all rest under gage
</br>Till we assign you to your days of trial.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
</br>From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
</br>Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
</br>To the possession of thy royal hand:
</br>Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
</br>And long live Henry, fourth of that name!
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
</br>Marry. God forbid!
</br>Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
</br>Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
</br>Would God that any in this noble presence
</br>Were enough noble to be upright judge
</br>Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
</br>Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
</br>What subject can give sentence on his king?
</br>And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
</br>Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
</br>Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
</br>And shall the figure of God's majesty,
</br>His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
</br>Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
</br>Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
</br>And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
</br>That in a Christian climate souls refined
</br>Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
</br>I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
</br>Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
</br>My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
</br>Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
</br>And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
</br>The blood of English shall manure the ground,
</br>And future ages groan for this foul act;
</br>Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
</br>And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
</br>Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
</br>Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
</br>Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
</br>The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
</br>O, if you raise this house against this house,
</br>It will the woefullest division prove
</br>That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
</br>Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
</br>Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
</br>Of capital treason we arrest you here.
</br>My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
</br>To keep him safely till his day of trial.
</br>May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
</br>He may surrender; so we shall proceed
</br>Without suspicion.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>I will be his conduct.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
</br>Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
</br>Little are we beholding to your love,
</br>And little look'd for at your helping hands.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
</br>Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
</br>Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
</br>To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
</br>Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
</br>To this submission. Yet I well remember
</br>The favours of these men: were they not mine?
</br>Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
</br>So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
</br>Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.
</br>God save the king! Will no man say amen?
</br>Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
</br>God save the king! although I be not he;
</br>And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
</br>To do what service am I sent for hither?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>To do that office of thine own good will
</br>Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
</br>The resignation of thy state and crown
</br>To Henry Bolingbroke.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
</br>Here cousin:
</br>On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
</br>Now is this golden crown like a deep well
</br>That owes two buckets, filling one another,
</br>The emptier ever dancing in the air,
</br>The other down, unseen and full of water:
</br>That bucket down and full of tears am I,
</br>Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>I thought you had been willing to resign.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
</br>You may my glories and my state depose,
</br>But not my griefs; still am I king of those.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
</br>My care is loss of care, by old care done;
</br>Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
</br>The cares I give I have, though given away;
</br>They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Are you contented to resign the crown?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
</br>Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
</br>Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
</br>I give this heavy weight from off my head
</br>And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
</br>The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
</br>With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
</br>With mine own hands I give away my crown,
</br>With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
</br>With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
</br>All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
</br>My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
</br>My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
</br>God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
</br>God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
</br>Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
</br>And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
</br>Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
</br>And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
</br>God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
</br>And send him many years of sunshine days!
</br>What more remains?
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>No more, but that you read
</br>These accusations and these grievous crimes
</br>Committed by your person and your followers
</br>Against the state and profit of this land;
</br>That, by confessing them, the souls of men
</br>May deem that you are worthily deposed.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Must I do so? and must I ravel out
</br>My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
</br>If thy offences were upon record,
</br>Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
</br>To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
</br>There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
</br>Containing the deposing of a king
</br>And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
</br>Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:
</br>Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
</br>Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
</br>Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
</br>Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
</br>Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
</br>And water cannot wash away your sin.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
</br>And yet salt water blinds them not so much
</br>But they can see a sort of traitors here.
</br>Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
</br>I find myself a traitor with the rest;
</br>For I have given here my soul's consent
</br>To undeck the pompous body of a king;
</br>Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
</br>Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>My lord,--
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
</br>Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
</br>No, not that name was given me at the font,
</br>But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
</br>That I have worn so many winters out,
</br>And know not now what name to call myself!
</br>O that I were a mockery king of snow,
</br>Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
</br>To melt myself away in water-drops!
</br>Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
</br>An if my word be sterling yet in England,
</br>Let it command a mirror hither straight,
</br>That it may show me what a face I have,
</br>Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>The commons will not then be satisfied.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
</br>When I do see the very book indeed
</br>Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
</br>Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
</br>No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
</br>So many blows upon this face of mine,
</br>And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
</br>Like to my followers in prosperity,
</br>Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
</br>That every day under his household roof
</br>Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
</br>That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
</br>Was this the face that faced so many follies,
</br>And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
</br>A brittle glory shineth in this face:
</br>As brittle as the glory is the face;
</br>For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.
</br>Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
</br>How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
</br>The shadow or your face.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Say that again.
</br>The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
</br>'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
</br>And these external manners of laments
</br>Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
</br>That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
</br>There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
</br>For thy great bounty, that not only givest
</br>Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
</br>How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
</br>And then be gone and trouble you no more.
</br>Shall I obtain it?
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Name it, fair cousin.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
</br>For when I was a king, my flatterers
</br>Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
</br>I have a king here to my flatterer.
</br>Being so great, I have no need to beg.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Yet ask.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>And shall I have?
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>You shall.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Then give me leave to go.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Whither?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
</br>That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
</br>Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.
</br>
</br>Abbot:
</br>A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
</br>
</br>BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
</br>The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
</br>Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>You holy clergymen, is there no plot
</br>To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
</br>
</br>Abbot:
</br>My lord,
</br>Before I freely speak my mind herein,
</br>You shall not only take the sacrament
</br>To bury mine intents, but also to effect
</br>Whatever I shall happen to devise.
</br>I see your brows are full of discontent,
</br>Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
</br>Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay
</br>A plot shall show us all a merry day.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>This way the king will come; this is the way
</br>To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
</br>To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
</br>Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
</br>Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
</br>Have any resting for her true king's queen.
</br>But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
</br>My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
</br>That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
</br>And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
</br>Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
</br>Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
</br>And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
</br>Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,
</br>When triumph is become an alehouse guest?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
</br>To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
</br>To think our former state a happy dream;
</br>From which awaked, the truth of what we are
</br>Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
</br>To grim Necessity, and he and I
</br>Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
</br>And cloister thee in some religious house:
</br>Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
</br>Which our profane hours here have stricken down.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
</br>Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
</br>Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
</br>The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
</br>And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
</br>To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
</br>Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
</br>And fawn on rage with base humility,
</br>Which art a lion and a king of beasts?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
</br>I had been still a happy king of men.
</br>Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
</br>Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,
</br>As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
</br>In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
</br>With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
</br>Of woeful ages long ago betid;
</br>And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
</br>Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
</br>And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
</br>For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
</br>The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
</br>And in compassion weep the fire out;
</br>And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
</br>For the deposing of a rightful king.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
</br>You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
</br>And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
</br>With all swift speed you must away to France.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
</br>The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
</br>The time shall not be many hours of age
</br>More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
</br>Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,
</br>Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
</br>It is too little, helping him to all;
</br>And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
</br>To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
</br>Being ne'er so little urged, another way
</br>To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
</br>The love of wicked men converts to fear;
</br>That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
</br>To worthy danger and deserved death.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
</br>Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
</br>A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
</br>And then betwixt me and my married wife.
</br>Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
</br>And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
</br>Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
</br>Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
</br>My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
</br>She came adorned hither like sweet May,
</br>Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>And must we be divided? must we part?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Banish us both and send the king with me.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>That were some love but little policy.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Then whither he goes, thither let me go.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>So two, together weeping, make one woe.
</br>Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
</br>Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
</br>Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>So longest way shall have the longest moans.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
</br>And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
</br>Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
</br>Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
</br>One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
</br>Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.
</br>
</br>QUEEN:
</br>Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
</br>To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
</br>So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
</br>That I might strive to kill it with a groan.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
</br>Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
</br>When weeping made you break the story off,
</br>of our two cousins coming into London.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Where did I leave?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>At that sad stop, my lord,
</br>Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
</br>Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
</br>Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
</br>Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
</br>With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
</br>Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
</br>Bolingbroke!'
</br>You would have thought the very windows spake,
</br>So many greedy looks of young and old
</br>Through casements darted their desiring eyes
</br>Upon his visage, and that all the walls
</br>With painted imagery had said at once
</br>'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
</br>Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
</br>Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
</br>Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
</br>And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
</br>After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
</br>Are idly bent on him that enters next,
</br>Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
</br>Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
</br>Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
</br>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
</br>But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
</br>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
</br>His face still combating with tears and smiles,
</br>The badges of his grief and patience,
</br>That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
</br>The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
</br>And barbarism itself have pitied him.
</br>But heaven hath a hand in these events,
</br>To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
</br>To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
</br>Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Here comes my son Aumerle.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Aumerle that was;
</br>But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
</br>And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
</br>I am in parliament pledge for his truth
</br>And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
</br>That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
</br>God knows I had as lief be none as one.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
</br>Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
</br>What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>For aught I know, my lord, they do.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>You will be there, I know.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>If God prevent not, I purpose so.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
</br>Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>My lord, 'tis nothing.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>No matter, then, who see it;
</br>I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
</br>It is a matter of small consequence,
</br>Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
</br>I fear, I fear,--
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>What should you fear?
</br>'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
</br>For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
</br>That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
</br>Boy, let me see the writing.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
</br>Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>What is the matter, my lord?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Ho! who is within there?
</br>Saddle my horse.
</br>God for his mercy, what treachery is here!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Why, what is it, my lord?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
</br>Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
</br>I will appeach the villain.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>What is the matter?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Peace, foolish woman.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Good mother, be content; it is no more
</br>Than my poor life must answer.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Thy life answer!
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
</br>Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Give me my boots, I say.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Why, York, what wilt thou do?
</br>Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
</br>Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
</br>Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
</br>And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
</br>And rob me of a happy mother's name?
</br>Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Thou fond mad woman,
</br>Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
</br>A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
</br>And interchangeably set down their hands,
</br>To kill the king at Oxford.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>He shall be none;
</br>We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
</br>I would appeach him.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Hadst thou groan'd for him
</br>As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
</br>But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
</br>That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
</br>And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
</br>Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
</br>He is as like thee as a man may be,
</br>Not like to me, or any of my kin,
</br>And yet I love him.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Make way, unruly woman!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
</br>Spur post, and get before him to the king,
</br>And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
</br>I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
</br>I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
</br>And never will I rise up from the ground
</br>Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
</br>'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
</br>If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
</br>I would to God, my lords, he might be found:
</br>Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
</br>For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
</br>With unrestrained loose companions,
</br>Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
</br>And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
</br>Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
</br>Takes on the point of honour to support
</br>So dissolute a crew.
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
</br>And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>And what said the gallant?
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>His answer was, he would unto the stews,
</br>And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
</br>And wear it as a favour; and with that
</br>He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
</br>I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
</br>May happily bring forth. But who comes here?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Where is the king?
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>What means our cousin, that he stares and looks
</br>So wildly?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
</br>To have some conference with your grace alone.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
</br>What is the matter with our cousin now?
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
</br>My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
</br>Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Intended or committed was this fault?
</br>If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
</br>To win thy after-love I pardon thee.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
</br>That no man enter till my tale be done.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Have thy desire.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Villain, I'll make thee safe.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>What is the matter, uncle? speak;
</br>Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
</br>That we may arm us to encounter it.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
</br>The treason that my haste forbids me show.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
</br>I do repent me; read not my name there
</br>My heart is not confederate with my hand.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
</br>I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
</br>Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
</br>Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
</br>A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
</br>O loyal father of a treacherous son!
</br>Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
</br>From when this stream through muddy passages
</br>Hath held his current and defiled himself!
</br>Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
</br>And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
</br>This deadly blot in thy digressing son.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
</br>And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
</br>As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
</br>Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
</br>Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
</br>Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
</br>The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
</br>Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
</br>A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
</br>And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
</br>My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
</br>I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
</br>More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
</br>This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
</br>This let alone will all the rest confound.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
</br>Love loving not itself none other can.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
</br>Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Rise up, good aunt.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Not yet, I thee beseech:
</br>For ever will I walk upon my knees,
</br>And never see day that the happy sees,
</br>Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
</br>By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF AUMERLE:
</br>Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Against them both my true joints bended be.
</br>Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
</br>His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
</br>His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
</br>He prays but faintly and would be denied;
</br>We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
</br>His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
</br>Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
</br>His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
</br>Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
</br>Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
</br>That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Good aunt, stand up.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
</br>Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
</br>And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
</br>'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
</br>I never long'd to hear a word till now;
</br>Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
</br>The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
</br>No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
</br>
</br>DUKE OF YORK:
</br>Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
</br>Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
</br>That set'st the word itself against the word!
</br>Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
</br>The chopping French we do not understand.
</br>Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
</br>Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
</br>That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
</br>Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Good aunt, stand up.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>I do not sue to stand;
</br>Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
</br>Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
</br>Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
</br>But makes one pardon strong.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>With all my heart
</br>I pardon him.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>A god on earth thou art.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
</br>With all the rest of that consorted crew,
</br>Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
</br>Good uncle, help to order several powers
</br>To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:
</br>They shall not live within this world, I swear,
</br>But I will have them, if I once know where.
</br>Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
</br>Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.
</br>
</br>DUCHESS OF YORK:
</br>Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.
</br>
</br>EXTON:
</br>Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
</br>'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
</br>Was it not so?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>These were his very words.
</br>
</br>EXTON:
</br>'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
</br>And urged it twice together, did he not?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>He did.
</br>
</br>EXTON:
</br>And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
</br>And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
</br>That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
</br>Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
</br>I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>I have been studying how I may compare
</br>This prison where I live unto the world:
</br>And for because the world is populous
</br>And here is not a creature but myself,
</br>I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
</br>My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
</br>My soul the father; and these two beget
</br>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
</br>And these same thoughts people this little world,
</br>In humours like the people of this world,
</br>For no thought is contented. The better sort,
</br>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
</br>With scruples and do set the word itself
</br>Against the word:
</br>As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
</br>'It is as hard to come as for a camel
</br>To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
</br>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
</br>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
</br>May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
</br>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
</br>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
</br>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
</br>That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
</br>Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
</br>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
</br>That many have and others must sit there;
</br>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
</br>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
</br>Of such as have before endured the like.
</br>Thus play I in one person many people,
</br>And none contented: sometimes am I king;
</br>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
</br>And so I am: then crushing penury
</br>Persuades me I was better when a king;
</br>Then am I king'd again: and by and by
</br>Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
</br>And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
</br>Nor I nor any man that but man is
</br>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
</br>With being nothing. Music do I hear?
</br>Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
</br>When time is broke and no proportion kept!
</br>So is it in the music of men's lives.
</br>And here have I the daintiness of ear
</br>To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
</br>But for the concord of my state and time
</br>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
</br>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
</br>For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
</br>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
</br>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
</br>Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
</br>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
</br>Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
</br>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
</br>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
</br>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
</br>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
</br>While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
</br>This music mads me; let it sound no more;
</br>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
</br>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
</br>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
</br>For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
</br>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.
</br>
</br>Groom:
</br>Hail, royal prince!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Thanks, noble peer;
</br>The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
</br>What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
</br>Where no man never comes but that sad dog
</br>That brings me food to make misfortune live?
</br>
</br>Groom:
</br>I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
</br>When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
</br>With much ado at length have gotten leave
</br>To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
</br>O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
</br>In London streets, that coronation-day,
</br>When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
</br>That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
</br>That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
</br>How went he under him?
</br>
</br>Groom:
</br>So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
</br>That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
</br>This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
</br>Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
</br>Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
</br>Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
</br>Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
</br>Since thou, created to be awed by man,
</br>Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
</br>And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
</br>Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.
</br>
</br>Keeper:
</br>Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
</br>
</br>Groom:
</br>What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.
</br>
</br>Keeper:
</br>My lord, will't please you to fall to?
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.
</br>
</br>Keeper:
</br>My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
</br>lately came from the king, commands the contrary.
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
</br>Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.
</br>
</br>Keeper:
</br>Help, help, help!
</br>
</br>KING RICHARD II:
</br>How now! what means death in this rude assault?
</br>Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
</br>Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
</br>That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
</br>That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
</br>Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
</br>Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
</br>Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.
</br>
</br>EXTON:
</br>As full of valour as of royal blood:
</br>Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
</br>For now the devil, that told me I did well,
</br>Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
</br>This dead king to the living king I'll bear
</br>Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
</br>Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
</br>Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
</br>But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
</br>Welcome, my lord what is the news?
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
</br>The next news is, I have to London sent
</br>The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:
</br>The manner of their taking may appear
</br>At large discoursed in this paper here.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
</br>And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.
</br>
</br>LORD FITZWATER:
</br>My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
</br>The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
</br>Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
</br>That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
</br>Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.
</br>
</br>HENRY PERCY:
</br>The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
</br>With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
</br>Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
</br>But here is Carlisle living, to abide
</br>Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Carlisle, this is your doom:
</br>Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
</br>More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
</br>So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
</br>For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
</br>High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.
</br>
</br>EXTON:
</br>Great king, within this coffin I present
</br>Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
</br>The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
</br>Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
</br>A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
</br>Upon my head and all this famous land.
</br>
</br>EXTON:
</br>From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
</br>
</br>HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
</br>They love not poison that do poison need,
</br>Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
</br>I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
</br>The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
</br>But neither my good word nor princely favour:
</br>With Cain go wander through shades of night,
</br>And never show thy head by day nor light.
</br>Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
</br>That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
</br>Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
</br>And put on sullen black incontinent:
</br>I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
</br>To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
</br>March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
</br>In weeping after this untimely bier.
</br>
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>No, for then we should be colliers.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>I strike quickly, being moved.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
</br>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
</br>take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
</br>to the wall.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
</br>are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
</br>Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
</br>to the wall.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
</br>have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
</br>maids, and cut off their heads.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>The heads of the maids?
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
</br>take it in what sense thou wilt.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>They must take it in sense that feel it.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
</br>'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
</br>hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
</br>two of the house of the Montagues.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>How! turn thy back and run?
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Fear me not.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>No, marry; I fear thee!
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
</br>they list.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
</br>which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
</br>
</br>ABRAHAM:
</br>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>I do bite my thumb, sir.
</br>
</br>ABRAHAM:
</br>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>No.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
</br>bite my thumb, sir.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>Do you quarrel, sir?
</br>
</br>ABRAHAM:
</br>Quarrel sir! no, sir.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
</br>
</br>ABRAHAM:
</br>No better.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Well, sir.
</br>
</br>GREGORY:
</br>Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Yes, better, sir.
</br>
</br>ABRAHAM:
</br>You lie.
</br>
</br>SAMPSON:
</br>Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Part, fools!
</br>Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
</br>Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
</br>Or manage it to part these men with me.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
</br>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
</br>Have at thee, coward!
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
</br>Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
</br>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
</br>
</br>LADY MONTAGUE:
</br>Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
</br>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
</br>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
</br>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
</br>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
</br>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
</br>Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
</br>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
</br>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
</br>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
</br>Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
</br>And made Verona's ancient citizens
</br>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
</br>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
</br>Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
</br>If ever you disturb our streets again,
</br>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
</br>For this time, all the rest depart away:
</br>You Capulet; shall go along with me:
</br>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
</br>To know our further pleasure in this case,
</br>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
</br>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
</br>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Here were the servants of your adversary,
</br>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
</br>I drew to part them: in the instant came
</br>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
</br>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
</br>He swung about his head and cut the winds,
</br>Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
</br>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
</br>Came more and more and fought on part and part,
</br>Till the prince came, who parted either part.
</br>
</br>LADY MONTAGUE:
</br>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
</br>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
</br>Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
</br>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
</br>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
</br>That westward rooteth from the city's side,
</br>So early walking did I see your son:
</br>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
</br>And stole into the covert of the wood:
</br>I, measuring his affections by my own,
</br>That most are busied when they're most alone,
</br>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
</br>And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Many a morning hath he there been seen,
</br>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
</br>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
</br>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
</br>Should in the furthest east begin to draw
</br>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
</br>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
</br>And private in his chamber pens himself,
</br>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
</br>And makes himself an artificial night:
</br>Black and portentous must this humour prove,
</br>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>I neither know it nor can learn of him.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Have you importuned him by any means?
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Both by myself and many other friends:
</br>But he, his own affections' counsellor,
</br>Is to himself--I will not say how true--
</br>But to himself so secret and so close,
</br>So far from sounding and discovery,
</br>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
</br>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
</br>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
</br>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
</br>We would as willingly give cure as know.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
</br>I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
</br>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Good-morrow, cousin.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Is the day so young?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>But new struck nine.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Ay me! sad hours seem long.
</br>Was that my father that went hence so fast?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>In love?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Out--
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Of love?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Out of her favour, where I am in love.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
</br>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
</br>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
</br>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
</br>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
</br>Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
</br>Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
</br>O any thing, of nothing first create!
</br>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
</br>Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
</br>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
</br>sick health!
</br>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
</br>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
</br>Dost thou not laugh?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>No, coz, I rather weep.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Good heart, at what?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>At thy good heart's oppression.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Why, such is love's transgression.
</br>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
</br>Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
</br>With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
</br>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
</br>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
</br>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
</br>Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
</br>What is it else? a madness most discreet,
</br>A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
</br>Farewell, my coz.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Soft! I will go along;
</br>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
</br>This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>What, shall I groan and tell thee?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Groan! why, no.
</br>But sadly tell me who.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
</br>Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
</br>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
</br>With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
</br>And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
</br>From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
</br>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
</br>Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
</br>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
</br>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
</br>That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
</br>For beauty starved with her severity
</br>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
</br>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
</br>To merit bliss by making me despair:
</br>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
</br>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O, teach me how I should forget to think.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
</br>Examine other beauties.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>'Tis the way
</br>To call hers exquisite, in question more:
</br>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
</br>Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
</br>He that is strucken blind cannot forget
</br>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
</br>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
</br>What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
</br>Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
</br>Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>But Montague is bound as well as I,
</br>In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
</br>For men so old as we to keep the peace.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Of honourable reckoning are you both;
</br>And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
</br>But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>But saying o'er what I have said before:
</br>My child is yet a stranger in the world;
</br>She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
</br>Let two more summers wither in their pride,
</br>Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Younger than she are happy mothers made.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
</br>The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
</br>She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
</br>But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
</br>My will to her consent is but a part;
</br>An she agree, within her scope of choice
</br>Lies my consent and fair according voice.
</br>This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
</br>Whereto I have invited many a guest,
</br>Such as I love; and you, among the store,
</br>One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
</br>At my poor house look to behold this night
</br>Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
</br>Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
</br>When well-apparell'd April on the heel
</br>Of limping winter treads, even such delight
</br>Among fresh female buds shall you this night
</br>Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
</br>And like her most whose merit most shall be:
</br>Which on more view, of many mine being one
</br>May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
</br>Come, go with me.
</br>Go, sirrah, trudge about
</br>Through fair Verona; find those persons out
</br>Whose names are written there, and to them say,
</br>My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Find them out whose names are written here! It is
</br>written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
</br>yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
</br>his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
</br>sent to find those persons whose names are here
</br>writ, and can never find what names the writing
</br>person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
</br>One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
</br>Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
</br>One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
</br>Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
</br>And the rank poison of the old will die.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>For what, I pray thee?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>For your broken shin.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
</br>Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
</br>Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
</br>pray, can you read any thing you see?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Stay, fellow; I can read.
</br>'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
</br>County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
</br>widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
</br>nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
</br>uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
</br>Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
</br>Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
</br>assembly: whither should they come?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Up.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Whither?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>To supper; to our house.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Whose house?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>My master's.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
</br>great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
</br>of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
</br>Rest you merry!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
</br>Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
</br>With all the admired beauties of Verona:
</br>Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
</br>Compare her face with some that I shall show,
</br>And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>When the devout religion of mine eye
</br>Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
</br>And these, who often drown'd could never die,
</br>Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
</br>One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
</br>Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
</br>Herself poised with herself in either eye:
</br>But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
</br>Your lady's love against some other maid
</br>That I will show you shining at this feast,
</br>And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
</br>But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
</br>I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
</br>God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>How now! who calls?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Your mother.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Madam, I am here.
</br>What is your will?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
</br>We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
</br>I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
</br>Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>She's not fourteen.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
</br>And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
</br>She is not fourteen. How long is it now
</br>To Lammas-tide?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>A fortnight and odd days.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Even or odd, of all days in the year,
</br>Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
</br>Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
</br>Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
</br>She was too good for me: but, as I said,
</br>On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
</br>That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
</br>'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
</br>And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
</br>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
</br>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
</br>Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
</br>My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
</br>Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
</br>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
</br>Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
</br>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
</br>Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
</br>To bid me trudge:
</br>And since that time it is eleven years;
</br>For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
</br>She could have run and waddled all about;
</br>For even the day before, she broke her brow:
</br>And then my husband--God be with his soul!
</br>A' was a merry man--took up the child:
</br>'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
</br>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
</br>Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
</br>The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
</br>To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
</br>I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
</br>I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
</br>And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
</br>To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
</br>And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
</br>A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
</br>A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
</br>'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
</br>Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
</br>Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
</br>Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
</br>An I might live to see thee married once,
</br>I have my wish.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
</br>I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
</br>How stands your disposition to be married?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>It is an honour that I dream not of.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
</br>I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
</br>Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
</br>Are made already mothers: by my count,
</br>I was your mother much upon these years
</br>That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
</br>The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>A man, young lady! lady, such a man
</br>As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>What say you? can you love the gentleman?
</br>This night you shall behold him at our feast;
</br>Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
</br>And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
</br>Examine every married lineament,
</br>And see how one another lends content
</br>And what obscured in this fair volume lies
</br>Find written in the margent of his eyes.
</br>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
</br>To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
</br>The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
</br>For fair without the fair within to hide:
</br>That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
</br>That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
</br>So shall you share all that he doth possess,
</br>By having him, making yourself no less.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
</br>But no more deep will I endart mine eye
</br>Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
</br>called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
</br>the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
</br>hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>We follow thee.
</br>Juliet, the county stays.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
</br>Or shall we on without a apology?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>The date is out of such prolixity:
</br>We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
</br>Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
</br>Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
</br>Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
</br>After the prompter, for our entrance:
</br>But let them measure us by what they will;
</br>We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
</br>Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
</br>With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
</br>So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
</br>And soar with them above a common bound.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
</br>To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
</br>I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
</br>Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
</br>Too great oppression for a tender thing.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
</br>Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
</br>Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
</br>Give me a case to put my visage in:
</br>A visor for a visor! what care I
</br>What curious eye doth quote deformities?
</br>Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
</br>But every man betake him to his legs.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
</br>Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
</br>For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
</br>I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
</br>The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
</br>If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
</br>Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
</br>Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Nay, that's not so.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>I mean, sir, in delay
</br>We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
</br>Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
</br>Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>And we mean well in going to this mask;
</br>But 'tis no wit to go.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Why, may one ask?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I dream'd a dream to-night.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>And so did I.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Well, what was yours?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>That dreamers often lie.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
</br>She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
</br>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
</br>On the fore-finger of an alderman,
</br>Drawn with a team of little atomies
</br>Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
</br>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
</br>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
</br>The traces of the smallest spider's web,
</br>The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
</br>Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
</br>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
</br>Not so big as a round little worm
</br>Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
</br>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
</br>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
</br>Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
</br>And in this state she gallops night by night
</br>Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
</br>O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
</br>O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
</br>O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
</br>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
</br>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
</br>Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
</br>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
</br>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
</br>Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
</br>Then dreams, he of another benefice:
</br>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
</br>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
</br>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
</br>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
</br>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
</br>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
</br>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
</br>That plats the manes of horses in the night,
</br>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
</br>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
</br>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
</br>That presses them and learns them first to bear,
</br>Making them women of good carriage:
</br>This is she--
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
</br>Thou talk'st of nothing.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>True, I talk of dreams,
</br>Which are the children of an idle brain,
</br>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
</br>Which is as thin of substance as the air
</br>And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
</br>Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
</br>And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
</br>Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
</br>Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
</br>Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
</br>Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
</br>With this night's revels and expire the term
</br>Of a despised life closed in my breast
</br>By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
</br>But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
</br>Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Strike, drum.
</br>
</br>First Servant:
</br>Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
</br>shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
</br>
</br>Second Servant:
</br>When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
</br>hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
</br>
</br>First Servant:
</br>Away with the joint-stools, remove the
</br>court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
</br>me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
</br>the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
</br>Antony, and Potpan!
</br>
</br>Second Servant:
</br>Ay, boy, ready.
</br>
</br>First Servant:
</br>You are looked for and called for, asked for and
</br>sought for, in the great chamber.
</br>
</br>Second Servant:
</br>We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
</br>brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
</br>Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
</br>Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
</br>Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
</br>She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
</br>Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
</br>That I have worn a visor and could tell
</br>A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
</br>Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
</br>You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
</br>A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
</br>More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
</br>And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
</br>Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
</br>Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
</br>For you and I are past our dancing days:
</br>How long is't now since last yourself and I
</br>Were in a mask?
</br>
</br>Second Capulet:
</br>By'r lady, thirty years.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
</br>'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
</br>Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
</br>Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
</br>
</br>Second Capulet:
</br>'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
</br>His son is thirty.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Will you tell me that?
</br>His son was but a ward two years ago.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>I know not, sir.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
</br>It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
</br>Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
</br>Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
</br>So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
</br>As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
</br>The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
</br>And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
</br>Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
</br>For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
</br>Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
</br>Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
</br>To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
</br>Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
</br>To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
</br>A villain that is hither come in spite,
</br>To scorn at our solemnity this night.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Young Romeo is it?
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
</br>He bears him like a portly gentleman;
</br>And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
</br>To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
</br>I would not for the wealth of all the town
</br>Here in my house do him disparagement:
</br>Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
</br>It is my will, the which if thou respect,
</br>Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
</br>And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
</br>I'll not endure him.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>He shall be endured:
</br>What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
</br>Am I the master here, or you? go to.
</br>You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
</br>You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
</br>You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Go to, go to;
</br>You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
</br>This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
</br>You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
</br>Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
</br>Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
</br>I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
</br>Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
</br>I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
</br>Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
</br>Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
</br>For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
</br>And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
</br>They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
</br>Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
</br>Give me my sin again.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>You kiss by the book.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>What is her mother?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Marry, bachelor,
</br>Her mother is the lady of the house,
</br>And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
</br>I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
</br>I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
</br>Shall have the chinks.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Is she a Capulet?
</br>O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
</br>We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
</br>Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
</br>I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
</br>More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
</br>Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
</br>I'll to my rest.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>The son and heir of old Tiberio.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>What's he that now is going out of door?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>I know not.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Go ask his name: if he be married.
</br>My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
</br>The only son of your great enemy.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>My only love sprung from my only hate!
</br>Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
</br>Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
</br>That I must love a loathed enemy.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>What's this? what's this?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>A rhyme I learn'd even now
</br>Of one I danced withal.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Anon, anon!
</br>Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
</br>
</br>Chorus:
</br>Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
</br>And young affection gapes to be his heir;
</br>That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
</br>With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
</br>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
</br>Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
</br>But to his foe supposed he must complain,
</br>And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
</br>Being held a foe, he may not have access
</br>To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
</br>And she as much in love, her means much less
</br>To meet her new-beloved any where:
</br>But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
</br>Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Can I go forward when my heart is here?
</br>Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>He is wise;
</br>And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
</br>Call, good Mercutio.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Nay, I'll conjure too.
</br>Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
</br>Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
</br>Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
</br>Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
</br>Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
</br>One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
</br>Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
</br>When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
</br>He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
</br>The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
</br>I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
</br>By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
</br>By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
</br>And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
</br>That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
</br>To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
</br>Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
</br>Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
</br>That were some spite: my invocation
</br>Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
</br>I conjure only but to raise up him.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
</br>To be consorted with the humorous night:
</br>Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
</br>Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
</br>And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
</br>As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
</br>Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
</br>An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
</br>Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
</br>This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
</br>Come, shall we go?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Go, then; for 'tis in vain
</br>To seek him here that means not to be found.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
</br>But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
</br>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
</br>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
</br>Who is already sick and pale with grief,
</br>That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
</br>Be not her maid, since she is envious;
</br>Her vestal livery is but sick and green
</br>And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
</br>It is my lady, O, it is my love!
</br>O, that she knew she were!
</br>She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
</br>Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
</br>I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
</br>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
</br>Having some business, do entreat her eyes
</br>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
</br>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
</br>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
</br>As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
</br>Would through the airy region stream so bright
</br>That birds would sing and think it were not night.
</br>See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
</br>O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
</br>That I might touch that cheek!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Ay me!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>She speaks:
</br>O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
</br>As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
</br>As is a winged messenger of heaven
</br>Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
</br>Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
</br>When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
</br>And sails upon the bosom of the air.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
</br>Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
</br>Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
</br>And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
</br>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
</br>What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
</br>Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
</br>Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
</br>What's in a name? that which we call a rose
</br>By any other name would smell as sweet;
</br>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
</br>Retain that dear perfection which he owes
</br>Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
</br>And for that name which is no part of thee
</br>Take all myself.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I take thee at thy word:
</br>Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
</br>Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
</br>So stumblest on my counsel?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>By a name
</br>I know not how to tell thee who I am:
</br>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
</br>Because it is an enemy to thee;
</br>Had I it written, I would tear the word.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
</br>Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
</br>Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
</br>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
</br>And the place death, considering who thou art,
</br>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
</br>For stony limits cannot hold love out,
</br>And what love can do that dares love attempt;
</br>Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
</br>Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
</br>And I am proof against their enmity.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I would not for the world they saw thee here.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
</br>And but thou love me, let them find me here:
</br>My life were better ended by their hate,
</br>Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
</br>He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
</br>I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
</br>As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
</br>I would adventure for such merchandise.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
</br>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
</br>For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
</br>Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
</br>What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
</br>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
</br>And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
</br>Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
</br>Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
</br>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
</br>Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
</br>I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
</br>So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
</br>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
</br>And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
</br>But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
</br>Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
</br>I should have been more strange, I must confess,
</br>But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
</br>My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
</br>And not impute this yielding to light love,
</br>Which the dark night hath so discovered.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
</br>That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
</br>That monthly changes in her circled orb,
</br>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>What shall I swear by?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Do not swear at all;
</br>Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
</br>Which is the god of my idolatry,
</br>And I'll believe thee.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>If my heart's dear love--
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
</br>I have no joy of this contract to-night:
</br>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
</br>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
</br>Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
</br>This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
</br>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
</br>Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
</br>Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
</br>And yet I would it were to give again.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>But to be frank, and give it thee again.
</br>And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
</br>My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
</br>My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
</br>The more I have, for both are infinite.
</br>I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
</br>Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
</br>Stay but a little, I will come again.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
</br>Being in night, all this is but a dream,
</br>Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
</br>If that thy bent of love be honourable,
</br>Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
</br>By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
</br>Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
</br>And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
</br>And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
</br>I do beseech thee--
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>By and by, I come:--
</br>To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
</br>To-morrow will I send.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>So thrive my soul--
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>A thousand times good night!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
</br>Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
</br>their books,
</br>But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
</br>To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
</br>Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
</br>Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
</br>And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
</br>With repetition of my Romeo's name.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>It is my soul that calls upon my name:
</br>How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
</br>Like softest music to attending ears!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Romeo!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>My dear?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>At what o'clock to-morrow
</br>Shall I send to thee?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>At the hour of nine.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
</br>I have forgot why I did call thee back.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Let me stand here till thou remember it.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
</br>Remembering how I love thy company.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
</br>Forgetting any other home but this.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
</br>And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
</br>Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
</br>Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
</br>And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
</br>So loving-jealous of his liberty.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I would I were thy bird.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Sweet, so would I:
</br>Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
</br>Good night, good night! parting is such
</br>sweet sorrow,
</br>That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
</br>Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
</br>Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
</br>His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
</br>Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
</br>And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
</br>From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
</br>Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
</br>The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
</br>I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
</br>With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
</br>The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
</br>What is her burying grave that is her womb,
</br>And from her womb children of divers kind
</br>We sucking on her natural bosom find,
</br>Many for many virtues excellent,
</br>None but for some and yet all different.
</br>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
</br>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
</br>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
</br>But to the earth some special good doth give,
</br>Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
</br>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
</br>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
</br>And vice sometimes by action dignified.
</br>Within the infant rind of this small flower
</br>Poison hath residence and medicine power:
</br>For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
</br>Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
</br>Two such opposed kings encamp them still
</br>In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
</br>And where the worser is predominant,
</br>Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Good morrow, father.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Benedicite!
</br>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
</br>Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
</br>So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
</br>Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
</br>And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
</br>But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
</br>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
</br>Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
</br>Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
</br>Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
</br>Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
</br>I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
</br>I have been feasting with mine enemy,
</br>Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
</br>That's by me wounded: both our remedies
</br>Within thy help and holy physic lies:
</br>I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
</br>My intercession likewise steads my foe.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
</br>Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
</br>On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
</br>As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
</br>And all combined, save what thou must combine
</br>By holy marriage: when and where and how
</br>We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
</br>I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
</br>That thou consent to marry us to-day.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
</br>Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
</br>So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
</br>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
</br>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
</br>Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
</br>How much salt water thrown away in waste,
</br>To season love, that of it doth not taste!
</br>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
</br>Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
</br>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
</br>Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
</br>If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
</br>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
</br>And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
</br>Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>And bad'st me bury love.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Not in a grave,
</br>To lay one in, another out to have.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
</br>Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
</br>The other did not so.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>O, she knew well
</br>Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
</br>But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
</br>In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
</br>For this alliance may so happy prove,
</br>To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Where the devil should this Romeo be?
</br>Came he not home to-night?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
</br>Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
</br>Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>A challenge, on my life.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Romeo will answer it.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Any man that can write may answer a letter.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
</br>dares, being dared.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
</br>white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
</br>love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
</br>blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
</br>encounter Tybalt?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Why, what is Tybalt?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
</br>the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
</br>you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
</br>proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
</br>the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
</br>button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
</br>very first house, of the first and second cause:
</br>ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
</br>hai!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>The what?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
</br>fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
</br>a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
</br>whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
</br>grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
</br>these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
</br>perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
</br>that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
</br>bones, their bones!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
</br>how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
</br>that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
</br>kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
</br>be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
</br>Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
</br>eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
</br>Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
</br>to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
</br>fairly last night.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
</br>such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
</br>constrains a man to bow in the hams.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Meaning, to court'sy.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Thou hast most kindly hit it.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>A most courteous exposition.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Pink for flower.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Right.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Why, then is my pump well flowered.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
</br>worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
</br>is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
</br>singleness.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
</br>done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
</br>thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
</br>was I with you there for the goose?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
</br>not there for the goose.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Nay, good goose, bite not.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
</br>sharp sauce.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
</br>inch narrow to an ell broad!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
</br>to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
</br>now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
</br>thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
</br>for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
</br>that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Stop there, stop there.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
</br>for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
</br>meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Here's goodly gear!
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>A sail, a sail!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Peter!
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>Anon!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>My fan, Peter.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
</br>fairer face.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Is it good den?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
</br>dial is now upon the prick of noon.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Out upon you! what a man are you!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
</br>mar.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
</br>quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
</br>may find the young Romeo?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
</br>you have found him than he was when you sought him:
</br>I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>You say well.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
</br>wisely, wisely.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
</br>you.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>She will indite him to some supper.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>What hast thou found?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
</br>that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
</br>An old hare hoar,
</br>And an old hare hoar,
</br>Is very good meat in lent
</br>But a hare that is hoar
</br>Is too much for a score,
</br>When it hoars ere it be spent.
</br>Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
</br>to dinner, thither.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I will follow you.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
</br>'lady, lady, lady.'
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
</br>merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
</br>and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
</br>to in a month.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
</br>down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
</br>Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
</br>Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
</br>none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
</br>too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
</br>should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
</br>draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
</br>good quarrel, and the law on my side.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
</br>me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
</br>and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
</br>out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
</br>but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
</br>a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
</br>kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
</br>is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
</br>with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
</br>to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
</br>protest unto thee--
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
</br>Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
</br>I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Bid her devise
</br>Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
</br>And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
</br>Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>No truly sir; not a penny.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Go to; I say you shall.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
</br>Within this hour my man shall be with thee
</br>And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
</br>Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
</br>Must be my convoy in the secret night.
</br>Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
</br>Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
</br>Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
</br>
</br>NURSE:
</br>Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
</br>Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
</br>is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
</br>lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
</br>see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
</br>sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
</br>man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
</br>as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
</br>rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
</br>the--No; I know it begins with some other
</br>letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
</br>it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
</br>to hear it.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Commend me to thy lady.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Ay, a thousand times.
</br>Peter!
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>Anon!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
</br>In half an hour she promised to return.
</br>Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
</br>O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
</br>Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
</br>Driving back shadows over louring hills:
</br>Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
</br>And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
</br>Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
</br>Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
</br>Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
</br>Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
</br>She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
</br>My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
</br>And his to me:
</br>But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
</br>Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
</br>O God, she comes!
</br>O honey nurse, what news?
</br>Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Peter, stay at the gate.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
</br>Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
</br>If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
</br>By playing it to me with so sour a face.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
</br>Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
</br>Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
</br>Do you not see that I am out of breath?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
</br>To say to me that thou art out of breath?
</br>The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
</br>Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
</br>Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
</br>Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
</br>Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
</br>how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
</br>face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
</br>all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
</br>though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
</br>past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
</br>but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
</br>ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>No, no: but all this did I know before.
</br>What says he of our marriage? what of that?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
</br>It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
</br>My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
</br>Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
</br>To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
</br>Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
</br>courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
</br>warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Where is my mother! why, she is within;
</br>Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
</br>'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
</br>Where is your mother?'
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O God's lady dear!
</br>Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
</br>Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
</br>Henceforward do your messages yourself.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I have.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
</br>There stays a husband to make you a wife:
</br>Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
</br>They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
</br>Hie you to church; I must another way,
</br>To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
</br>Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
</br>I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
</br>But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
</br>Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
</br>That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
</br>It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
</br>That one short minute gives me in her sight:
</br>Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
</br>Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
</br>It is enough I may but call her mine.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>These violent delights have violent ends
</br>And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
</br>Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
</br>Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
</br>And in the taste confounds the appetite:
</br>Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
</br>Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
</br>Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
</br>Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
</br>A lover may bestride the gossamer
</br>That idles in the wanton summer air,
</br>And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Good even to my ghostly confessor.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
</br>Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
</br>To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
</br>This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
</br>Unfold the imagined happiness that both
</br>Receive in either by this dear encounter.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
</br>Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
</br>They are but beggars that can count their worth;
</br>But my true love is grown to such excess
</br>I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
</br>For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
</br>Till holy church incorporate two in one.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
</br>The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
</br>And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
</br>For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
</br>enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
</br>upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
</br>thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
</br>it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Am I like such a fellow?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
</br>any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
</br>soon moody to be moved.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>And what to?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
</br>shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
</br>thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
</br>or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
</br>wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
</br>other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
</br>eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
</br>Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
</br>meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
</br>an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
</br>man for coughing in the street, because he hath
</br>wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
</br>didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
</br>his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
</br>tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
</br>wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
</br>should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>The fee-simple! O simple!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>By my head, here come the Capulets.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>By my heel, I care not.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
</br>Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>And but one word with one of us? couple it with
</br>something; make it a word and a blow.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
</br>will give me occasion.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Could you not take some occasion without giving?
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
</br>thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
</br>discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
</br>make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>We talk here in the public haunt of men:
</br>Either withdraw unto some private place,
</br>And reason coldly of your grievances,
</br>Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
</br>I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
</br>Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
</br>Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
</br>No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
</br>Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
</br>To such a greeting: villain am I none;
</br>Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
</br>That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I do protest, I never injured thee,
</br>But love thee better than thou canst devise,
</br>Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
</br>And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
</br>As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
</br>Alla stoccata carries it away.
</br>Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>What wouldst thou have with me?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
</br>lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
</br>shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
</br>eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
</br>by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
</br>ears ere it be out.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>I am for you.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Come, sir, your passado.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
</br>Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
</br>Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
</br>Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
</br>Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>I am hurt.
</br>A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
</br>Is he gone, and hath nothing?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>What, art thou hurt?
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
</br>Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
</br>church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
</br>me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
</br>am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
</br>both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
</br>cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
</br>rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
</br>arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
</br>was hurt under your arm.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I thought all for the best.
</br>
</br>MERCUTIO:
</br>Help me into some house, Benvolio,
</br>Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
</br>They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
</br>And soundly too: your houses!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
</br>My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
</br>In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
</br>With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
</br>Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
</br>Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
</br>And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
</br>That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
</br>Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
</br>This but begins the woe, others must end.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
</br>Away to heaven, respective lenity,
</br>And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
</br>Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
</br>That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
</br>Is but a little way above our heads,
</br>Staying for thine to keep him company:
</br>Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
</br>
</br>TYBALT:
</br>Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
</br>Shalt with him hence.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>This shall determine that.
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Romeo, away, be gone!
</br>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
</br>Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
</br>If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O, I am fortune's fool!
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Why dost thou stay?
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
</br>Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>There lies that Tybalt.
</br>
</br>First Citizen:
</br>Up, sir, go with me;
</br>I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>O noble prince, I can discover all
</br>The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
</br>There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
</br>That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
</br>O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
</br>O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
</br>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
</br>O cousin, cousin!
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
</br>
</br>BENVOLIO:
</br>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
</br>Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
</br>How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
</br>Your high displeasure: all this uttered
</br>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
</br>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
</br>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
</br>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
</br>Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
</br>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
</br>Cold death aside, and with the other sends
</br>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
</br>Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
</br>'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
</br>his tongue,
</br>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
</br>And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
</br>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
</br>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
</br>But by and by comes back to Romeo,
</br>Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
</br>And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
</br>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
</br>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
</br>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>He is a kinsman to the Montague;
</br>Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
</br>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
</br>And all those twenty could but kill one life.
</br>I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
</br>Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
</br>Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
</br>His fault concludes but what the law should end,
</br>The life of Tybalt.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>And for that offence
</br>Immediately we do exile him hence:
</br>I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
</br>My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
</br>But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
</br>That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
</br>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
</br>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
</br>Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
</br>Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
</br>Bear hence this body and attend our will:
</br>Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
</br>Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
</br>As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
</br>And bring in cloudy night immediately.
</br>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
</br>That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
</br>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
</br>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
</br>By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
</br>It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
</br>Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
</br>And learn me how to lose a winning match,
</br>Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
</br>Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
</br>With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
</br>Think true love acted simple modesty.
</br>Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
</br>For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
</br>Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
</br>Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
</br>Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
</br>Take him and cut him out in little stars,
</br>And he will make the face of heaven so fine
</br>That all the world will be in love with night
</br>And pay no worship to the garish sun.
</br>O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
</br>But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
</br>Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
</br>As is the night before some festival
</br>To an impatient child that hath new robes
</br>And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
</br>And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
</br>But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
</br>Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
</br>That Romeo bid thee fetch?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Ay, ay, the cords.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
</br>We are undone, lady, we are undone!
</br>Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Can heaven be so envious?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Romeo can,
</br>Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
</br>Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
</br>This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
</br>Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
</br>And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
</br>Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
</br>I am not I, if there be such an I;
</br>Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
</br>If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
</br>Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
</br>God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
</br>A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
</br>Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
</br>All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
</br>To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
</br>Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
</br>And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
</br>O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
</br>That ever I should live to see thee dead!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>What storm is this that blows so contrary?
</br>Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
</br>My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
</br>Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
</br>For who is living, if those two are gone?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
</br>Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
</br>Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
</br>Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
</br>Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
</br>Despised substance of divinest show!
</br>Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
</br>A damned saint, an honourable villain!
</br>O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
</br>When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
</br>In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
</br>Was ever book containing such vile matter
</br>So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
</br>In such a gorgeous palace!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>There's no trust,
</br>No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
</br>All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
</br>Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
</br>These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
</br>Shame come to Romeo!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Blister'd be thy tongue
</br>For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
</br>Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
</br>For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
</br>Sole monarch of the universal earth.
</br>O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
</br>Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
</br>When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
</br>But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
</br>That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
</br>Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
</br>Your tributary drops belong to woe,
</br>Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
</br>My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
</br>And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
</br>All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
</br>Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
</br>That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
</br>But, O, it presses to my memory,
</br>Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
</br>'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
</br>That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
</br>Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
</br>Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
</br>Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
</br>And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
</br>Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
</br>Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
</br>Which modern lamentations might have moved?
</br>But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
</br>'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
</br>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
</br>All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
</br>There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
</br>In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
</br>Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
</br>Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
</br>When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
</br>Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
</br>Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
</br>He made you for a highway to my bed;
</br>But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
</br>Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
</br>And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
</br>To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
</br>Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
</br>I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
</br>And bid him come to take his last farewell.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
</br>Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
</br>And thou art wedded to calamity.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
</br>What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
</br>That I yet know not?
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Too familiar
</br>Is my dear son with such sour company:
</br>I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
</br>Not body's death, but body's banishment.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
</br>For exile hath more terror in his look,
</br>Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Hence from Verona art thou banished:
</br>Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>There is no world without Verona walls,
</br>But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
</br>Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
</br>And world's exile is death: then banished,
</br>Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
</br>Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
</br>And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
</br>Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
</br>Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
</br>And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
</br>This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
</br>Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
</br>And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
</br>Live here in heaven and may look on her;
</br>But Romeo may not: more validity,
</br>More honourable state, more courtship lives
</br>In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
</br>On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
</br>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
</br>Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
</br>Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
</br>But Romeo may not; he is banished:
</br>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
</br>They are free men, but I am banished.
</br>And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
</br>Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
</br>No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
</br>But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
</br>O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
</br>Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
</br>Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
</br>A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
</br>To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
</br>Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
</br>To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
</br>Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
</br>Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
</br>It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
</br>Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
</br>An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
</br>Doting like me and like me banished,
</br>Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
</br>And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
</br>Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
</br>Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
</br>Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
</br>Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
</br>What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
</br>Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Welcome, then.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
</br>Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O, he is even in my mistress' case,
</br>Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
</br>Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
</br>Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
</br>Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
</br>For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
</br>Why should you fall into so deep an O?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Nurse!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
</br>Doth she not think me an old murderer,
</br>Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
</br>With blood removed but little from her own?
</br>Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
</br>My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
</br>And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
</br>And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
</br>And then down falls again.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>As if that name,
</br>Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
</br>Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
</br>Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
</br>In what vile part of this anatomy
</br>Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
</br>The hateful mansion.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Hold thy desperate hand:
</br>Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
</br>Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
</br>The unreasonable fury of a beast:
</br>Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
</br>Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
</br>Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
</br>I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
</br>Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
</br>And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
</br>By doing damned hate upon thyself?
</br>Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
</br>Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
</br>In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
</br>Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
</br>Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
</br>And usest none in that true use indeed
</br>Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
</br>Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
</br>Digressing from the valour of a man;
</br>Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
</br>Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
</br>Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
</br>Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
</br>Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
</br>Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
</br>And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
</br>What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
</br>For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
</br>There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
</br>But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
</br>The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
</br>And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
</br>A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
</br>Happiness courts thee in her best array;
</br>But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
</br>Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
</br>Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
</br>Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
</br>Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
</br>But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
</br>For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
</br>Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
</br>To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
</br>Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
</br>With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
</br>Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
</br>Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
</br>And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
</br>Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
</br>Romeo is coming.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
</br>To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
</br>My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
</br>Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>How well my comfort is revived by this!
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
</br>Either be gone before the watch be set,
</br>Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
</br>Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
</br>And he shall signify from time to time
</br>Every good hap to you that chances here:
</br>Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
</br>It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
</br>That we have had no time to move our daughter:
</br>Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
</br>And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
</br>'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
</br>I promise you, but for your company,
</br>I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>These times of woe afford no time to woo.
</br>Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
</br>To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
</br>Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
</br>In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
</br>Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
</br>Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
</br>And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
</br>But, soft! what day is this?
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Monday, my lord,
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
</br>O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
</br>She shall be married to this noble earl.
</br>Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
</br>We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
</br>For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
</br>It may be thought we held him carelessly,
</br>Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
</br>Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
</br>And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
</br>Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
</br>Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
</br>Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
</br>Afore me! it is so very very late,
</br>That we may call it early by and by.
</br>Good night.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
</br>It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
</br>That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
</br>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
</br>Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
</br>No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
</br>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
</br>Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
</br>Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
</br>I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
</br>It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
</br>To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
</br>And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
</br>Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
</br>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
</br>I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
</br>'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
</br>Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
</br>The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
</br>I have more care to stay than will to go:
</br>Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
</br>How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
</br>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
</br>Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
</br>Some say the lark makes sweet division;
</br>This doth not so, for she divideth us:
</br>Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
</br>O, now I would they had changed voices too!
</br>Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
</br>Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
</br>O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Madam!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Nurse?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
</br>The day is broke; be wary, look about.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
</br>I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
</br>For in a minute there are many days:
</br>O, by this count I shall be much in years
</br>Ere I again behold my Romeo!
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Farewell!
</br>I will omit no opportunity
</br>That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
</br>For sweet discourses in our time to come.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
</br>Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
</br>As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
</br>Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
</br>Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
</br>If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
</br>That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
</br>For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
</br>But send him back.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
</br>Is she not down so late, or up so early?
</br>What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Why, how now, Juliet!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Madam, I am not well.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
</br>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
</br>An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
</br>Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
</br>But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
</br>Which you weep for.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Feeling so the loss,
</br>Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
</br>As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>What villain madam?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>That same villain, Romeo.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
</br>Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
</br>Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
</br>Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
</br>Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
</br>That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
</br>And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
</br>With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
</br>Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
</br>Madam, if you could find out but a man
</br>To bear a poison, I would temper it;
</br>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
</br>Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
</br>To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
</br>To wreak the love I bore my cousin
</br>Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
</br>But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>And joy comes well in such a needy time:
</br>What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
</br>One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
</br>Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
</br>That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
</br>The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
</br>The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
</br>Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
</br>He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
</br>I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
</br>Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
</br>I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
</br>I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
</br>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
</br>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
</br>And see how he will take it at your hands.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
</br>But for the sunset of my brother's son
</br>It rains downright.
</br>How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
</br>Evermore showering? In one little body
</br>Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
</br>For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
</br>Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
</br>Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
</br>Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
</br>Without a sudden calm, will overset
</br>Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
</br>Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
</br>I would the fool were married to her grave!
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
</br>How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
</br>Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
</br>Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
</br>So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
</br>Proud can I never be of what I hate;
</br>But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
</br>'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
</br>And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
</br>Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
</br>But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
</br>To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
</br>Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
</br>Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
</br>You tallow-face!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
</br>Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
</br>I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
</br>Or never after look me in the face:
</br>Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
</br>My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
</br>That God had lent us but this only child;
</br>But now I see this one is one too much,
</br>And that we have a curse in having her:
</br>Out on her, hilding!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>God in heaven bless her!
</br>You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
</br>Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>I speak no treason.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>O, God ye god-den.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>May not one speak?
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Peace, you mumbling fool!
</br>Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
</br>For here we need it not.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>You are too hot.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>God's bread! it makes me mad:
</br>Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
</br>Alone, in company, still my care hath been
</br>To have her match'd: and having now provided
</br>A gentleman of noble parentage,
</br>Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
</br>Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
</br>Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
</br>And then to have a wretched puling fool,
</br>A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
</br>To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
</br>I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
</br>But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
</br>Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
</br>Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
</br>Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
</br>An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
</br>And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
</br>the streets,
</br>For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
</br>Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
</br>Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
</br>That sees into the bottom of my grief?
</br>O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
</br>Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
</br>Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
</br>In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
</br>Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
</br>My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
</br>How shall that faith return again to earth,
</br>Unless that husband send it me from heaven
</br>By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
</br>Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
</br>Upon so soft a subject as myself!
</br>What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
</br>Some comfort, nurse.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Faith, here it is.
</br>Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
</br>That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
</br>Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
</br>Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
</br>I think it best you married with the county.
</br>O, he's a lovely gentleman!
</br>Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
</br>Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
</br>As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
</br>I think you are happy in this second match,
</br>For it excels your first: or if it did not,
</br>Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
</br>As living here and you no use of him.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Speakest thou from thy heart?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>And from my soul too;
</br>Or else beshrew them both.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Amen!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>What?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
</br>Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
</br>Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
</br>To make confession and to be absolved.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
</br>Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
</br>Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
</br>Which she hath praised him with above compare
</br>So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
</br>Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
</br>I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
</br>If all else fail, myself have power to die.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>My father Capulet will have it so;
</br>And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>You say you do not know the lady's mind:
</br>Uneven is the course, I like it not.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
</br>And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
</br>For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
</br>Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
</br>That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
</br>And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
</br>To stop the inundation of her tears;
</br>Which, too much minded by herself alone,
</br>May be put from her by society:
</br>Now do you know the reason of this haste.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Happily met, my lady and my wife!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>What must be shall be.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>That's a certain text.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Come you to make confession to this father?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>To answer that, I should confess to you.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Do not deny to him that you love me.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I will confess to you that I love him.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>If I do so, it will be of more price,
</br>Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>The tears have got small victory by that;
</br>For it was bad enough before their spite.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
</br>And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>It may be so, for it is not mine own.
</br>Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
</br>Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
</br>My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>God shield I should disturb devotion!
</br>Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
</br>Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
</br>Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
</br>It strains me past the compass of my wits:
</br>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
</br>On Thursday next be married to this county.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
</br>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
</br>If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
</br>Do thou but call my resolution wise,
</br>And with this knife I'll help it presently.
</br>God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
</br>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
</br>Shall be the label to another deed,
</br>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
</br>Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
</br>Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
</br>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
</br>'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
</br>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
</br>Which the commission of thy years and art
</br>Could to no issue of true honour bring.
</br>Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
</br>If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
</br>Which craves as desperate an execution.
</br>As that is desperate which we would prevent.
</br>If, rather than to marry County Paris,
</br>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
</br>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
</br>A thing like death to chide away this shame,
</br>That copest with death himself to scape from it:
</br>And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
</br>From off the battlements of yonder tower;
</br>Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
</br>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
</br>Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
</br>O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
</br>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
</br>Or bid me go into a new-made grave
</br>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
</br>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
</br>And I will do it without fear or doubt,
</br>To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
</br>To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
</br>To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
</br>Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
</br>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
</br>And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
</br>When presently through all thy veins shall run
</br>A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
</br>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
</br>No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
</br>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
</br>To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
</br>Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
</br>Each part, deprived of supple government,
</br>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
</br>And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
</br>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
</br>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
</br>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
</br>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
</br>Then, as the manner of our country is,
</br>In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
</br>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
</br>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
</br>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
</br>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
</br>And hither shall he come: and he and I
</br>Will watch thy waking, and that very night
</br>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
</br>And this shall free thee from this present shame;
</br>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
</br>Abate thy valour in the acting it.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
</br>In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
</br>To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
</br>Farewell, dear father!
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>So many guests invite as here are writ.
</br>Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
</br>
</br>Second Servant:
</br>You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
</br>can lick their fingers.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>How canst thou try them so?
</br>
</br>Second Servant:
</br>Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
</br>own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
</br>fingers goes not with me.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Go, be gone.
</br>We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
</br>What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Ay, forsooth.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
</br>A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
</br>Of disobedient opposition
</br>To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
</br>By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
</br>And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
</br>Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Send for the county; go tell him of this:
</br>I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
</br>And gave him what becomed love I might,
</br>Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
</br>This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
</br>Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
</br>Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
</br>Our whole city is much bound to him.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
</br>To help me sort such needful ornaments
</br>As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
</br>
</br>LADY  CAPULET:
</br>We shall be short in our provision:
</br>'Tis now near night.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Tush, I will stir about,
</br>And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
</br>Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
</br>I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
</br>I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
</br>They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
</br>To County Paris, to prepare him up
</br>Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
</br>Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
</br>I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
</br>For I have need of many orisons
</br>To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
</br>Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
</br>As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
</br>So please you, let me now be left alone,
</br>And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
</br>For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
</br>In this so sudden business.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Good night:
</br>Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
</br>I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
</br>That almost freezes up the heat of life:
</br>I'll call them back again to comfort me:
</br>Nurse! What should she do here?
</br>My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
</br>Come, vial.
</br>What if this mixture do not work at all?
</br>Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
</br>No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
</br>What if it be a poison, which the friar
</br>Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
</br>Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
</br>Because he married me before to Romeo?
</br>I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
</br>For he hath still been tried a holy man.
</br>How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
</br>I wake before the time that Romeo
</br>Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
</br>Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
</br>To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
</br>And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
</br>Or, if I live, is it not very like,
</br>The horrible conceit of death and night,
</br>Together with the terror of the place,--
</br>As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
</br>Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
</br>Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
</br>Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
</br>Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
</br>At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
</br>Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
</br>So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
</br>And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
</br>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
</br>O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
</br>Environed with all these hideous fears?
</br>And madly play with my forefather's joints?
</br>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
</br>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
</br>As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
</br>O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
</br>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
</br>Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
</br>Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
</br>The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
</br>Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
</br>Spare not for the cost.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Go, you cot-quean, go,
</br>Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
</br>For this night's watching.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
</br>All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
</br>But I will watch you from such watching now.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
</br>Now, fellow,
</br>What's there?
</br>
</br>First Servant:
</br>Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Make haste, make haste.
</br>Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
</br>Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
</br>
</br>Second Servant:
</br>I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
</br>And never trouble Peter for the matter.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
</br>Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
</br>The county will be here with music straight,
</br>For so he said he would: I hear him near.
</br>Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
</br>Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
</br>I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
</br>Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
</br>Make haste, I say.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
</br>Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
</br>Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
</br>What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
</br>Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
</br>The County Paris hath set up his rest,
</br>That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
</br>Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
</br>I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
</br>Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
</br>He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
</br>What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
</br>I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
</br>Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
</br>O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
</br>Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>What noise is here?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O lamentable day!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>What is the matter?
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Look, look! O heavy day!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>O me, O me! My child, my only life,
</br>Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
</br>Help, help! Call help.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
</br>Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
</br>Life and these lips have long been separated:
</br>Death lies on her like an untimely frost
</br>Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O lamentable day!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>O woful time!
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
</br>Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Ready to go, but never to return.
</br>O son! the night before thy wedding-day
</br>Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
</br>Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
</br>Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
</br>My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
</br>And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
</br>And doth it give me such a sight as this?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
</br>Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
</br>In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
</br>But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
</br>But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
</br>And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
</br>Most lamentable day, most woful day,
</br>That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
</br>O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
</br>Never was seen so black a day as this:
</br>O woful day, O woful day!
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
</br>Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
</br>By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
</br>O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
</br>Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
</br>To murder, murder our solemnity?
</br>O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
</br>Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
</br>And with my child my joys are buried.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
</br>In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
</br>Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
</br>And all the better is it for the maid:
</br>Your part in her you could not keep from death,
</br>But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
</br>The most you sought was her promotion;
</br>For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
</br>And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
</br>Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
</br>O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
</br>That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
</br>She's not well married that lives married long;
</br>But she's best married that dies married young.
</br>Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
</br>On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
</br>In all her best array bear her to church:
</br>For though fond nature bids us an lament,
</br>Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>All things that we ordained festival,
</br>Turn from their office to black funeral;
</br>Our instruments to melancholy bells,
</br>Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
</br>Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
</br>Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
</br>And all things change them to the contrary.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
</br>And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
</br>To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
</br>The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
</br>Move them no more by crossing their high will.
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
</br>
</br>Nurse:
</br>Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
</br>For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
</br>ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>Why 'Heart's ease?'
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
</br>heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
</br>to comfort me.
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>You will not, then?
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>No.
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>I will then give it you soundly.
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>What will you give us?
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
</br>I will give you the minstrel.
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>Then I will give you the serving-creature.
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
</br>your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
</br>I'll fa you; do you note me?
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>An you re us and fa us, you note us.
</br>
</br>Second Musician:
</br>Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
</br>with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
</br>me like men:
</br>'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
</br>And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
</br>Then music with her silver sound'--
</br>why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
</br>sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
</br>
</br>Musician:
</br>Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
</br>
</br>Second Musician:
</br>I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
</br>
</br>Third Musician:
</br>Faith, I know not what to say.
</br>
</br>PETER:
</br>O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
</br>for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
</br>because musicians have no gold for sounding:
</br>'Then music with her silver sound
</br>With speedy help doth lend redress.'
</br>
</br>First Musician:
</br>What a pestilent knave is this same!
</br>
</br>Second Musician:
</br>Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
</br>mourners, and stay dinner.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
</br>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
</br>My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
</br>And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
</br>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
</br>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
</br>Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
</br>to think!--
</br>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
</br>That I revived, and was an emperor.
</br>Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
</br>When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
</br>News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
</br>Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
</br>How doth my lady? Is my father well?
</br>How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
</br>For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
</br>Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
</br>And her immortal part with angels lives.
</br>I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
</br>And presently took post to tell it you:
</br>O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
</br>Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
</br>Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
</br>And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
</br>Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
</br>Some misadventure.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Tush, thou art deceived:
</br>Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
</br>Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>No, my good lord.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>No matter: get thee gone,
</br>And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
</br>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
</br>Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
</br>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
</br>I do remember an apothecary,--
</br>And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
</br>In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
</br>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
</br>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
</br>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
</br>An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
</br>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
</br>A beggarly account of empty boxes,
</br>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
</br>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
</br>Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
</br>Noting this penury, to myself I said
</br>'An if a man did need a poison now,
</br>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
</br>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
</br>O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
</br>And this same needy man must sell it me.
</br>As I remember, this should be the house.
</br>Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
</br>What, ho! apothecary!
</br>
</br>Apothecary:
</br>Who calls so loud?
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
</br>Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
</br>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
</br>As will disperse itself through all the veins
</br>That the life-weary taker may fall dead
</br>And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
</br>As violently as hasty powder fired
</br>Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
</br>
</br>Apothecary:
</br>Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
</br>Is death to any he that utters them.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
</br>And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
</br>Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
</br>Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
</br>The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
</br>The world affords no law to make thee rich;
</br>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
</br>
</br>Apothecary:
</br>My poverty, but not my will, consents.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
</br>
</br>Apothecary:
</br>Put this in any liquid thing you will,
</br>And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
</br>Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
</br>Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
</br>Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
</br>I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
</br>Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
</br>Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
</br>To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
</br>
</br>FRIAR JOHN:
</br>Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>This same should be the voice of Friar John.
</br>Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
</br>Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
</br>
</br>FRIAR JOHN:
</br>Going to find a bare-foot brother out
</br>One of our order, to associate me,
</br>Here in this city visiting the sick,
</br>And finding him, the searchers of the town,
</br>Suspecting that we both were in a house
</br>Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
</br>Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
</br>So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
</br>
</br>FRIAR JOHN:
</br>I could not send it,--here it is again,--
</br>Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
</br>So fearful were they of infection.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
</br>The letter was not nice but full of charge
</br>Of dear import, and the neglecting it
</br>May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
</br>Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
</br>Unto my cell.
</br>
</br>FRIAR JOHN:
</br>Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Now must I to the monument alone;
</br>Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
</br>She will beshrew me much that Romeo
</br>Hath had no notice of these accidents;
</br>But I will write again to Mantua,
</br>And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
</br>Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
</br>Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
</br>Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
</br>Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
</br>So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
</br>Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
</br>But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
</br>As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
</br>Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
</br>
</br>PAGE:
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
</br>O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
</br>Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
</br>Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
</br>The obsequies that I for thee will keep
</br>Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
</br>The boy gives warning something doth approach.
</br>What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
</br>To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
</br>What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
</br>Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
</br>See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
</br>Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
</br>Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
</br>And do not interrupt me in my course.
</br>Why I descend into this bed of death,
</br>Is partly to behold my lady's face;
</br>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
</br>A precious ring, a ring that I must use
</br>In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
</br>But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
</br>In what I further shall intend to do,
</br>By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
</br>And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
</br>The time and my intents are savage-wild,
</br>More fierce and more inexorable far
</br>Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
</br>Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
</br>Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
</br>Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
</br>And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
</br>That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
</br>It is supposed, the fair creature died;
</br>And here is come to do some villanous shame
</br>To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
</br>Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
</br>Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
</br>Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
</br>Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
</br>Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
</br>Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
</br>Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
</br>Put not another sin upon my head,
</br>By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
</br>By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
</br>For I come hither arm'd against myself:
</br>Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
</br>A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>I do defy thy conjurations,
</br>And apprehend thee for a felon here.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
</br>
</br>PAGE:
</br>O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
</br>
</br>PARIS:
</br>O, I am slain!
</br>If thou be merciful,
</br>Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
</br>
</br>ROMEO:
</br>In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
</br>Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
</br>What said my man, when my betossed soul
</br>Did not attend him as we rode? I think
</br>He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
</br>Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
</br>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
</br>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
</br>One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
</br>I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
</br>A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
</br>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
</br>This vault a feasting presence full of light.
</br>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
</br>How oft when men are at the point of death
</br>Have they been merry! which their keepers call
</br>A lightning before death: O, how may I
</br>Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
</br>Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
</br>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
</br>Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
</br>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
</br>And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
</br>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
</br>O, what more favour can I do to thee,
</br>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
</br>To sunder his that was thine enemy?
</br>Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
</br>Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
</br>That unsubstantial death is amorous,
</br>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
</br>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
</br>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
</br>And never from this palace of dim night
</br>Depart again: here, here will I remain
</br>With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
</br>Will I set up my everlasting rest,
</br>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
</br>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
</br>Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
</br>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
</br>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
</br>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
</br>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
</br>The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
</br>Here's to my love!
</br>O true apothecary!
</br>Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
</br>Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
</br>What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
</br>To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
</br>It burneth in the Capel's monument.
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
</br>One that you love.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Who is it?
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>Romeo.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>How long hath he been there?
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>Full half an hour.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Go with me to the vault.
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>I dare not, sir
</br>My master knows not but I am gone hence;
</br>And fearfully did menace me with death,
</br>If I did stay to look on his intents.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
</br>O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
</br>I dreamt my master and another fought,
</br>And that my master slew him.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>Romeo!
</br>Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
</br>The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
</br>What mean these masterless and gory swords
</br>To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
</br>Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
</br>And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
</br>Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
</br>The lady stirs.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
</br>I do remember well where I should be,
</br>And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
</br>Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
</br>A greater power than we can contradict
</br>Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
</br>Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
</br>And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
</br>Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
</br>Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
</br>Come, go, good Juliet,
</br>I dare no longer stay.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
</br>What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
</br>Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
</br>O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
</br>To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
</br>Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
</br>To make die with a restorative.
</br>Thy lips are warm.
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
</br>This is thy sheath;
</br>there rust, and let me die.
</br>
</br>PAGE:
</br>This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
</br>Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
</br>Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
</br>And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
</br>Who here hath lain these two days buried.
</br>Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
</br>Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
</br>We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
</br>But the true ground of all these piteous woes
</br>We cannot without circumstance descry.
</br>
</br>Second Watchman:
</br>Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
</br>
</br>Third Watchman:
</br>Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
</br>We took this mattock and this spade from him,
</br>As he was coming from this churchyard side.
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>What misadventure is so early up,
</br>That calls our person from our morning's rest?
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>The people in the street cry Romeo,
</br>Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
</br>With open outcry toward our monument.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>What fear is this which startles in our ears?
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
</br>And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
</br>Warm and new kill'd.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
</br>With instruments upon them, fit to open
</br>These dead men's tombs.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
</br>This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
</br>Is empty on the back of Montague,--
</br>And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
</br>
</br>LADY CAPULET:
</br>O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
</br>That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
</br>To see thy son and heir more early down.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
</br>Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
</br>What further woe conspires against mine age?
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Look, and thou shalt see.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
</br>To press before thy father to a grave?
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
</br>Till we can clear these ambiguities,
</br>And know their spring, their head, their
</br>true descent;
</br>And then will I be general of your woes,
</br>And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
</br>And let mischance be slave to patience.
</br>Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>I am the greatest, able to do least,
</br>Yet most suspected, as the time and place
</br>Doth make against me of this direful murder;
</br>And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
</br>Myself condemned and myself excused.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
</br>
</br>FRIAR LAURENCE:
</br>I will be brief, for my short date of breath
</br>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
</br>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
</br>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
</br>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
</br>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
</br>Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
</br>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
</br>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
</br>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
</br>To County Paris: then comes she to me,
</br>And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
</br>To rid her from this second marriage,
</br>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
</br>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
</br>A sleeping potion; which so took effect
</br>As I intended, for it wrought on her
</br>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
</br>That he should hither come as this dire night,
</br>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
</br>Being the time the potion's force should cease.
</br>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
</br>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
</br>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
</br>At the prefixed hour of her waking,
</br>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
</br>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
</br>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
</br>But when I came, some minute ere the time
</br>Of her awaking, here untimely lay
</br>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
</br>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
</br>And bear this work of heaven with patience:
</br>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
</br>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
</br>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
</br>All this I know; and to the marriage
</br>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
</br>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
</br>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
</br>Unto the rigour of severest law.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>We still have known thee for a holy man.
</br>Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
</br>
</br>BALTHASAR:
</br>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
</br>And then in post he came from Mantua
</br>To this same place, to this same monument.
</br>This letter he early bid me give his father,
</br>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
</br>I departed not and left him there.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>Give me the letter; I will look on it.
</br>Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
</br>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
</br>
</br>PAGE:
</br>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
</br>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
</br>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
</br>And by and by my master drew on him;
</br>And then I ran away to call the watch.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>This letter doth make good the friar's words,
</br>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
</br>And here he writes that he did buy a poison
</br>Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
</br>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
</br>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
</br>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
</br>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
</br>And I for winking at your discords too
</br>Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
</br>This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
</br>Can I demand.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>But I can give thee more:
</br>For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
</br>That while Verona by that name is known,
</br>There shall no figure at such rate be set
</br>As that of true and faithful Juliet.
</br>
</br>CAPULET:
</br>As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
</br>Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
</br>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
</br>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
</br>Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
</br>For never was a story of more woe
</br>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
</br>He slily stole away and left his men:
</br>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
</br>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
</br>Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
</br>Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
</br>Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
</br>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
</br>Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
</br>I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
</br>That this is true, father, behold his blood.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
</br>Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
</br>But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
</br>Before I see thee seated in that throne
</br>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
</br>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
</br>This is the palace of the fearful king,
</br>And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
</br>For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
</br>For hither we have broken in by force.
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
</br>And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>And when the king comes, offer no violence,
</br>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>The queen this day here holds her parliament,
</br>But little thinks we shall be of her council:
</br>By words or blows here let us win our right.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
</br>Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
</br>And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
</br>Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
</br>I mean to take possession of my right.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
</br>The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
</br>Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
</br>I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
</br>Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
</br>Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
</br>Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
</br>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
</br>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
</br>And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
</br>On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
</br>
</br>WESTMORELAND:
</br>What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
</br>My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
</br>He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
</br>My gracious lord, here in the parliament
</br>Let us assail the family of York.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Ah, know you not the city favours them,
</br>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
</br>To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
</br>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
</br>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
</br>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
</br>and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
</br>I am thy sovereign.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>I am thine.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
</br>In following this usurping Henry.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Whom should he follow but his natural king?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>It must and shall be so: content thyself.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
</br>
</br>WESTMORELAND:
</br>He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
</br>And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
</br>That we are those which chased you from the field
</br>And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
</br>March'd through the city to the palace gates.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
</br>And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
</br>
</br>WESTMORELAND:
</br>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
</br>Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
</br>Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
</br>I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
</br>As shall revenge his death before I stir.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Will you we show our title to the crown?
</br>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
</br>Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
</br>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
</br>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
</br>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
</br>And seized upon their towns and provinces.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>The lord protector lost it, and not I:
</br>When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
</br>Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
</br>Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Sons, peace!
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
</br>And be you silent and attentive too,
</br>For he that interrupts him shall not live.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
</br>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
</br>No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
</br>Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
</br>And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
</br>Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
</br>My title's good, and better far than his.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>'Twas by rebellion against his king.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>What then?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>An if he may, then am I lawful king;
</br>For Richard, in the view of many lords,
</br>Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
</br>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>He rose against him, being his sovereign,
</br>And made him to resign his crown perforce.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
</br>Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>No; for he could not so resign his crown
</br>But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
</br>Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
</br>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
</br>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
</br>Can set the duke up in despite of me.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
</br>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
</br>May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
</br>Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
</br>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
</br>Or I will fill the house with armed men,
</br>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
</br>Write up his title with usurping blood.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
</br>Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
</br>And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
</br>Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>What good is this to England and himself!
</br>
</br>WESTMORELAND:
</br>Base, fearful and despairing Henry!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
</br>
</br>WESTMORELAND:
</br>I cannot stay to hear these articles.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Nor I.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
</br>
</br>WESTMORELAND:
</br>Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
</br>In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
</br>And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
</br>Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Ah, Exeter!
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Why should you sigh, my lord?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
</br>Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
</br>But be it as it may: I here entail
</br>The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
</br>Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
</br>To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
</br>To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
</br>And neither by treason nor hostility
</br>To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>This oath I willingly take and will perform.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
</br>
</br>NORFOLK:
</br>And I to Norfolk with my followers.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>And I unto the sea from whence I came.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
</br>I'll steal away.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Exeter, so will I.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Who can be patient in such extremes?
</br>Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
</br>And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
</br>Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
</br>Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
</br>Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
</br>Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
</br>Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
</br>Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
</br>Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
</br>And disinherited thine only son.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Father, you cannot disinherit me:
</br>If you be king, why should not I succeed?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
</br>The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
</br>I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
</br>Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
</br>And given unto the house of York such head
</br>As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
</br>To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
</br>What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
</br>And creep into it far before thy time?
</br>Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
</br>Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
</br>The duke is made protector of the realm;
</br>And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
</br>The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
</br>Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
</br>The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
</br>Before I would have granted to that act.
</br>But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
</br>And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
</br>Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
</br>Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
</br>Whereby my son is disinherited.
</br>The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
</br>Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
</br>And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
</br>And utter ruin of the house of York.
</br>Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
</br>Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>When I return with victory from the field
</br>I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
</br>Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
</br>Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
</br>Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
</br>Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
</br>Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
</br>The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
</br>I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
</br>Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>No, I can better play the orator.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>But I have reasons strong and forcible.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
</br>What is your quarrel? how began it first?
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>No quarrel, but a slight contention.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>About what?
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>About that which concerns your grace and us;
</br>The crown of England, father, which is yours.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Your right depends not on his life or death.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
</br>By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
</br>It will outrun you, father, in the end.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
</br>I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>I shall be, if I claim by open war.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>An oath is of no moment, being not took
</br>Before a true and lawful magistrate,
</br>That hath authority over him that swears:
</br>Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
</br>Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
</br>Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
</br>Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
</br>How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
</br>Within whose circuit is Elysium
</br>And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
</br>Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
</br>Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
</br>Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
</br>Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
</br>And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
</br>Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
</br>And tell him privily of our intent.
</br>You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
</br>With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
</br>In them I trust; for they are soldiers,
</br>Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
</br>While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
</br>But that I seek occasion how to rise,
</br>And yet the king not privy to my drift,
</br>Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
</br>But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>The queen with all the northern earls and lords
</br>Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
</br>She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
</br>And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
</br>Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
</br>My brother Montague shall post to London:
</br>Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
</br>Whom we have left protectors of the king,
</br>With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
</br>And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
</br>And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
</br>Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
</br>You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
</br>The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
</br>
</br>JOHN MORTIMER:
</br>She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>What, with five thousand men?
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
</br>A woman's general; what should we fear?
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
</br>And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
</br>I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
</br>Many a battle have I won in France,
</br>When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
</br>Why should I not now have the like success?
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>RUTLAND:
</br>Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
</br>Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
</br>As for the brat of this accursed duke,
</br>Whose father slew my father, he shall die.
</br>
</br>Tutor:
</br>And I, my lord, will bear him company.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Soldiers, away with him!
</br>
</br>Tutor:
</br>Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
</br>Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
</br>That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
</br>
</br>RUTLAND:
</br>So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
</br>That trembles under his devouring paws;
</br>And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
</br>And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
</br>Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
</br>And not with such a cruel threatening look.
</br>Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
</br>I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
</br>Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
</br>Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
</br>
</br>RUTLAND:
</br>Then let my father's blood open it again:
</br>He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
</br>Were not revenge sufficient for me;
</br>No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
</br>And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
</br>It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
</br>The sight of any of the house of York
</br>Is as a fury to torment my soul;
</br>And till I root out their accursed line
</br>And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
</br>Therefore--
</br>
</br>RUTLAND:
</br>O, let me pray before I take my death!
</br>To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
</br>
</br>RUTLAND:
</br>I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Thy father hath.
</br>
</br>RUTLAND:
</br>But 'twas ere I was born.
</br>Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
</br>Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
</br>He be as miserably slain as I.
</br>Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
</br>And when I give occasion of offence,
</br>Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>No cause!
</br>Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.
</br>
</br>RUTLAND:
</br>Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
</br>And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
</br>Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
</br>Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>The army of the queen hath got the field:
</br>My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
</br>And all my followers to the eager foe
</br>Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
</br>Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
</br>My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
</br>But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
</br>Like men born to renown by life or death.
</br>Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
</br>And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
</br>And full as oft came Edward to my side,
</br>With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
</br>In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
</br>And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
</br>Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
</br>And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
</br>A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
</br>With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
</br>We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
</br>With bootless labour swim against the tide
</br>And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
</br>Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
</br>And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
</br>And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
</br>The sands are number'd that make up my life;
</br>Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
</br>Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
</br>I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
</br>I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
</br>With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
</br>Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
</br>And made an evening at the noontide prick.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
</br>A bird that will revenge upon you all:
</br>And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
</br>Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
</br>Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
</br>So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
</br>So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
</br>Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
</br>And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;
</br>And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
</br>And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
</br>Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>I will not bandy with thee word for word,
</br>But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
</br>I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
</br>Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
</br>To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
</br>What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
</br>For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
</br>When he might spurn him with his foot away?
</br>It is war's prize to take all vantages;
</br>And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>So doth the cony struggle in the net.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
</br>So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>What would your grace have done unto him now?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
</br>Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
</br>That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
</br>Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
</br>What! was it you that would be England's king?
</br>Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
</br>And made a preachment of your high descent?
</br>Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
</br>The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
</br>And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
</br>Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
</br>Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
</br>Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
</br>Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
</br>That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
</br>Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
</br>And if thine eyes can water for his death,
</br>I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
</br>Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
</br>I should lament thy miserable state.
</br>I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
</br>What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
</br>That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
</br>Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
</br>And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
</br>Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
</br>Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
</br>York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
</br>A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
</br>Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
</br>Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
</br>Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
</br>And this is he was his adopted heir.
</br>But how is it that great Plantagenet
</br>Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
</br>As I bethink me, you should not be king
</br>Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
</br>And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
</br>And rob his temples of the diadem,
</br>Now in his life, against your holy oath?
</br>O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
</br>Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
</br>And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>That is my office, for my father's sake.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
</br>Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
</br>How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
</br>To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
</br>Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
</br>But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
</br>Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
</br>I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
</br>To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
</br>Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
</br>Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
</br>Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
</br>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
</br>Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
</br>It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
</br>Unless the adage must be verified,
</br>That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
</br>'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
</br>But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
</br>'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
</br>The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
</br>'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
</br>The want thereof makes thee abominable:
</br>Thou art as opposite to every good
</br>As the Antipodes are unto us,
</br>Or as the south to the septentrion.
</br>O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
</br>How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
</br>To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
</br>And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
</br>Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
</br>Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
</br>Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
</br>Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
</br>For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
</br>And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
</br>These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
</br>And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
</br>'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
</br>Frenchwoman.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
</br>That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>That face of his the hungry cannibals
</br>Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:
</br>But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
</br>O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
</br>See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
</br>This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
</br>And I with tears do wash the blood away.
</br>Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
</br>And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
</br>Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
</br>Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
</br>And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
</br>There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
</br>And in thy need such comfort come to thee
</br>As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
</br>Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:
</br>My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
</br>I should not for my life but weep with him.
</br>To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
</br>Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
</br>And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
</br>
</br>YORK:
</br>Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
</br>My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
</br>So York may overlook the town of York.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
</br>Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
</br>From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
</br>Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
</br>Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
</br>Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
</br>The happy tidings of his good escape.
</br>How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>I cannot joy, until I be resolved
</br>Where our right valiant father is become.
</br>I saw him in the battle range about;
</br>And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
</br>Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
</br>As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
</br>Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
</br>Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
</br>The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
</br>So fared our father with his enemies;
</br>So fled his enemies my warlike father:
</br>Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
</br>See how the morning opes her golden gates,
</br>And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
</br>How well resembles it the prime of youth,
</br>Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
</br>Not separated with the racking clouds,
</br>But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
</br>See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
</br>As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
</br>Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
</br>In this the heaven figures some event.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
</br>I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
</br>That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
</br>Each one already blazing by our meeds,
</br>Should notwithstanding join our lights together
</br>And over-shine the earth as this the world.
</br>Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
</br>Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
</br>You love the breeder better than the male.
</br>But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
</br>Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
</br>When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
</br>Your princely father and my loving lord!
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Environed he was with many foes,
</br>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
</br>Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
</br>But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
</br>And many strokes, though with a little axe,
</br>Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
</br>By many hands your father was subdued;
</br>But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
</br>Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
</br>Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
</br>Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
</br>The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
</br>A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
</br>Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
</br>And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
</br>They took his head, and on the gates of York
</br>They set the same; and there it doth remain,
</br>The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
</br>Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
</br>O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
</br>The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
</br>And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
</br>For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
</br>Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
</br>Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
</br>Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
</br>For never henceforth shall I joy again,
</br>Never, O never shall I see more joy!
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
</br>Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
</br>Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
</br>For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
</br>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
</br>And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
</br>To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
</br>Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
</br>Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
</br>Or die renowned by attempting it.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
</br>His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
</br>Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
</br>For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
</br>Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
</br>Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
</br>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
</br>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
</br>O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
</br>Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
</br>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
</br>And now, to add more measure to your woes,
</br>I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
</br>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
</br>Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
</br>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
</br>Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
</br>I, then in London keeper of the king,
</br>Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
</br>And very well appointed, as I thought,
</br>March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
</br>Bearing the king in my behalf along;
</br>For by my scouts I was advertised
</br>That she was coming with a full intent
</br>To dash our late decree in parliament
</br>Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
</br>Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
</br>Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
</br>But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
</br>Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
</br>That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
</br>Or whether 'twas report of her success;
</br>Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
</br>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
</br>I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
</br>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
</br>Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
</br>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
</br>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
</br>I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
</br>With promise of high pay and great rewards:
</br>But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
</br>And we in them no hope to win the day;
</br>So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
</br>Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
</br>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
</br>For in the marches here we heard you were,
</br>Making another head to fight again.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
</br>And when came George from Burgundy to England?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
</br>And for your brother, he was lately sent
</br>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
</br>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
</br>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
</br>But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
</br>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
</br>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
</br>And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
</br>Were he as famous and as bold in war
</br>As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
</br>'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
</br>But in this troublous time what's to be done?
</br>Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
</br>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
</br>Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
</br>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
</br>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
</br>If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
</br>And therefore comes my brother Montague.
</br>Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
</br>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
</br>And of their feather many more proud birds,
</br>Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
</br>He swore consent to your succession,
</br>His oath enrolled in the parliament;
</br>And now to London all the crew are gone,
</br>To frustrate both his oath and what beside
</br>May make against the house of Lancaster.
</br>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
</br>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
</br>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
</br>Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
</br>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
</br>Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
</br>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
</br>And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
</br>But never once again turn back and fly.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
</br>Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
</br>That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
</br>And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
</br>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
</br>The next degree is England's royal throne;
</br>For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
</br>In every borough as we pass along;
</br>And he that throws not up his cap for joy
</br>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
</br>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
</br>Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
</br>But sound the trumpets, and about our task.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
</br>As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
</br>I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>How now! what news?
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
</br>The queen is coming with a puissant host;
</br>And craves your company for speedy counsel.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
</br>Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
</br>That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
</br>Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
</br>To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
</br>Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
</br>Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>My gracious liege, this too much lenity
</br>And harmful pity must be laid aside.
</br>To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
</br>Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
</br>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
</br>Not his that spoils her young before her face.
</br>Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
</br>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
</br>The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
</br>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
</br>Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
</br>Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
</br>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
</br>And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
</br>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
</br>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
</br>Which argued thee a most unloving father.
</br>Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
</br>And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
</br>Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
</br>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
</br>Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
</br>Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
</br>Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
</br>For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
</br>Were it not pity that this goodly boy
</br>Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
</br>And long hereafter say unto his child,
</br>'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
</br>My careless father fondly gave away'?
</br>Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
</br>And let his manly face, which promiseth
</br>Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
</br>To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
</br>Inferring arguments of mighty force.
</br>But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
</br>That things ill-got had ever bad success?
</br>And happy always was it for that son
</br>Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
</br>I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
</br>And would my father had left me no more!
</br>For all the rest is held at such a rate
</br>As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
</br>Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
</br>Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
</br>How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
</br>And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
</br>You promised knighthood to our forward son:
</br>Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
</br>Edward, kneel down.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
</br>And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.
</br>
</br>PRINCE:
</br>My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
</br>I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
</br>And in that quarrel use it to the death.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Royal commanders, be in readiness:
</br>For with a band of thirty thousand men
</br>Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
</br>And in the towns, as they do march along,
</br>Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
</br>Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>I would your highness would depart the field:
</br>The queen hath best success when you are absent.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>Be it with resolution then to fight.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>My royal father, cheer these noble lords
</br>And hearten those that fight in your defence:
</br>Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
</br>And set thy diadem upon my head;
</br>Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
</br>Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
</br>Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
</br>I was adopted heir by his consent:
</br>Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
</br>You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
</br>Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
</br>To blot out me, and put his own son in.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>And reason too:
</br>Who should succeed the father but the son?
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
</br>Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
</br>When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
</br>Your legs did better service than your hands.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>You said so much before, and yet you fled.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
</br>
</br>NORTHUMBERLAND:
</br>No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
</br>Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
</br>The execution of my big-swoln heart
</br>Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
</br>As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
</br>But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
</br>I am a king, and privileged to speak.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
</br>Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
</br>By him that made us all, I am resolved
</br>that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
</br>A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
</br>That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
</br>For York in justice puts his armour on.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>If that be right which Warwick says is right,
</br>There is no wrong, but every thing is right.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
</br>For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
</br>But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
</br>Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
</br>As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
</br>Whose father bears the title of a king,--
</br>As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
</br>Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
</br>To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
</br>To make this shameless callet know herself.
</br>Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
</br>Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
</br>And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
</br>By that false woman, as this king by thee.
</br>His father revell'd in the heart of France,
</br>And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
</br>And had he match'd according to his state,
</br>He might have kept that glory to this day;
</br>But when he took a beggar to his bed,
</br>And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
</br>Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
</br>That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
</br>And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
</br>For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
</br>Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
</br>And we, in pity of the gentle king,
</br>Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
</br>
</br>GEORGE:
</br>But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
</br>And that thy summer bred us no increase,
</br>We set the axe to thy usurping root;
</br>And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
</br>Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
</br>We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
</br>Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
</br>Not willing any longer conference,
</br>Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
</br>Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
</br>And either victory, or else a grave.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Stay, Edward.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
</br>These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
</br>I lay me down a little while to breathe;
</br>For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
</br>Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
</br>And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
</br>For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?
</br>
</br>GEORGE:
</br>Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
</br>Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
</br>What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;
</br>And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
</br>Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
</br>Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
</br>And in the very pangs of death he cried,
</br>Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
</br>'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
</br>So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
</br>That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
</br>The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
</br>I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
</br>Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
</br>Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
</br>And look upon, as if the tragedy
</br>Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
</br>Here on my knee I vow to God above,
</br>I'll never pause again, never stand still,
</br>Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
</br>Or fortune given me measure of revenge.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
</br>And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
</br>And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
</br>I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
</br>Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
</br>Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
</br>That to my foes this body must be prey,
</br>Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
</br>And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
</br>Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
</br>Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
</br>Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:
</br>I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
</br>That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.
</br>
</br>GEORGE:
</br>Yet let us all together to our troops,
</br>And give them leave to fly that will not stay;
</br>And call them pillars that will stand to us;
</br>And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
</br>As victors wear at the Olympian games:
</br>This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
</br>For yet is hope of life and victory.
</br>Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
</br>Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
</br>And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
</br>Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
</br>This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;
</br>And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
</br>And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
</br>And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
</br>To execute the like upon thyself;
</br>And so, have at thee!
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;
</br>For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>This battle fares like to the morning's war,
</br>When dying clouds contend with growing light,
</br>What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
</br>Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
</br>Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
</br>Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
</br>Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
</br>Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
</br>Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
</br>Now one the better, then another best;
</br>Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
</br>Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
</br>So is the equal of this fell war.
</br>Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
</br>To whom God will, there be the victory!
</br>For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
</br>Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
</br>They prosper best of all when I am thence.
</br>Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
</br>For what is in this world but grief and woe?
</br>O God! methinks it were a happy life,
</br>To be no better than a homely swain;
</br>To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
</br>To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
</br>Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
</br>How many make the hour full complete;
</br>How many hours bring about the day;
</br>How many days will finish up the year;
</br>How many years a mortal man may live.
</br>When this is known, then to divide the times:
</br>So many hours must I tend my flock;
</br>So many hours must I take my rest;
</br>So many hours must I contemplate;
</br>So many hours must I sport myself;
</br>So many days my ewes have been with young;
</br>So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
</br>So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
</br>So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
</br>Pass'd over to the end they were created,
</br>Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
</br>Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
</br>Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
</br>To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
</br>Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
</br>To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
</br>O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
</br>And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
</br>His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
</br>His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
</br>All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
</br>Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
</br>His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
</br>His body couched in a curious bed,
</br>When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.
</br>
</br>Son:
</br>Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
</br>This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
</br>May be possessed with some store of crowns;
</br>And I, that haply take them from him now,
</br>May yet ere night yield both my life and them
</br>To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
</br>Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
</br>Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
</br>O heavy times, begetting such events!
</br>From London by the king was I press'd forth;
</br>My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
</br>Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
</br>And I, who at his hands received my life, him
</br>Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
</br>Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
</br>And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
</br>My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
</br>And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
</br>Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
</br>Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
</br>Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
</br>And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
</br>Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.
</br>
</br>Father:
</br>Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
</br>Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:
</br>For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
</br>But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
</br>Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
</br>Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
</br>Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
</br>Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
</br>Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
</br>O, pity, God, this miserable age!
</br>What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
</br>Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
</br>This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
</br>O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
</br>And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
</br>O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
</br>O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
</br>The red rose and the white are on his face,
</br>The fatal colours of our striving houses:
</br>The one his purple blood right well resembles;
</br>The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
</br>Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;
</br>If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.
</br>
</br>Son:
</br>How will my mother for a father's death
</br>Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
</br>
</br>Father:
</br>How will my wife for slaughter of my son
</br>Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>How will the country for these woful chances
</br>Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
</br>
</br>Son:
</br>Was ever son so rued a father's death?
</br>
</br>Father:
</br>Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
</br>Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
</br>
</br>Son:
</br>I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
</br>
</br>Father:
</br>These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
</br>My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
</br>For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
</br>My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
</br>And so obsequious will thy father be,
</br>Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
</br>As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
</br>I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
</br>For I have murdered where I should not kill.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
</br>Here sits a king more woful than you are.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
</br>And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
</br>Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
</br>Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
</br>Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
</br>With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
</br>And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
</br>Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
</br>Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
</br>Or else come after: I'll away before.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
</br>Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
</br>Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>CLIFFORD:
</br>Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
</br>Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
</br>O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
</br>More than my body's parting with my soul!
</br>My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
</br>And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
</br>Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
</br>The common people swarm like summer flies;
</br>And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
</br>And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
</br>O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
</br>That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
</br>Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
</br>And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
</br>Or as thy father and his father did,
</br>Giving no ground unto the house of York,
</br>They never then had sprung like summer flies;
</br>I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
</br>Had left no mourning widows for our death;
</br>And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
</br>For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
</br>And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
</br>Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
</br>No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
</br>The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
</br>For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
</br>The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
</br>And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
</br>Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
</br>I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
</br>And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
</br>Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
</br>That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
</br>As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
</br>Command an argosy to stem the waves.
</br>But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
</br>For, though before his face I speak the words
</br>Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
</br>And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
</br>If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
</br>Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
</br>In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
</br>But set his murdering knife unto the root
</br>From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
</br>I mean our princely father, Duke of York.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
</br>Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
</br>Instead whereof let this supply the room:
</br>Measure for measure must be answered.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
</br>That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
</br>Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
</br>And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>I think his understanding is bereft.
</br>Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
</br>Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
</br>And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
</br>'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
</br>Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
</br>Which in the time of death he gave our father.
</br>
</br>GEORGE:
</br>If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
</br>
</br>GEORGE:
</br>While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.
</br>
</br>GEORGE:
</br>Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
</br>When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
</br>I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
</br>If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
</br>That I in all despite might rail at him,
</br>This hand should chop it off, and with the
</br>issuing blood
</br>Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
</br>York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
</br>And rear it in the place your father's stands.
</br>And now to London with triumphant march,
</br>There to be crowned England's royal king:
</br>From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
</br>And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
</br>So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
</br>And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
</br>The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
</br>For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
</br>Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
</br>First will I see the coronation;
</br>And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
</br>To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
</br>For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
</br>And never will I undertake the thing
</br>Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
</br>Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
</br>And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
</br>Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
</br>
</br>RICHARD:
</br>Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
</br>For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Tut, that's a foolish observation:
</br>Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,
</br>To see these honours in possession.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>First Keeper:
</br>Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
</br>For through this laund anon the deer will come;
</br>And in this covert will we make our stand,
</br>Culling the principal of all the deer.
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
</br>
</br>First Keeper:
</br>That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
</br>Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
</br>Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
</br>And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
</br>I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
</br>In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
</br>To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
</br>No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
</br>Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
</br>Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
</br>No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
</br>No humble suitors press to speak for right,
</br>No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
</br>For how can I help them, and not myself?
</br>
</br>First Keeper:
</br>Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
</br>This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
</br>For wise men say it is the wisest course.
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
</br>
</br>First Keeper:
</br>Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
</br>And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
</br>Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
</br>To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
</br>Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
</br>For Warwick is a subtle orator,
</br>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
</br>By this account then Margaret may win him;
</br>For she's a woman to be pitied much:
</br>Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
</br>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
</br>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
</br>And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
</br>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
</br>Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
</br>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
</br>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
</br>She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
</br>He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
</br>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
</br>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
</br>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
</br>And in conclusion wins the king from her,
</br>With promise of his sister, and what else,
</br>To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
</br>O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
</br>Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
</br>A man at least, for less I should not be;
</br>And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
</br>Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
</br>Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
</br>A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
</br>Your crown content and you must be contented
</br>To go along with us; for as we think,
</br>You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
</br>And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
</br>Will apprehend you as his enemy.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>But did you never swear, and break an oath?
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
</br>
</br>Second Keeper:
</br>Here in this country, where we now remain.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>I was anointed king at nine months old;
</br>My father and my grandfather were kings,
</br>And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
</br>And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
</br>
</br>First Keeper:
</br>No;
</br>For we were subjects but while you were king.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
</br>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
</br>Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
</br>And as the air blows it to me again,
</br>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
</br>And yielding to another when it blows,
</br>Commanded always by the greater gust;
</br>Such is the lightness of you common men.
</br>But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
</br>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
</br>Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
</br>And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
</br>
</br>First Keeper:
</br>We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>So would you be again to Henry,
</br>If he were seated as King Edward is.
</br>
</br>First Keeper:
</br>We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
</br>To go with us unto the officers.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
</br>And what God will, that let your king perform;
</br>And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
</br>This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
</br>His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
</br>Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
</br>Which we in justice cannot well deny,
</br>Because in quarrel of the house of York
</br>The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
</br>It were dishonour to deny it her.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Widow, we will consider of your suit;
</br>And come some other time to know our mind.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
</br>May it please your highness to resolve me now;
</br>And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Three, my most gracious lord.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>And would you not do much to do them good?
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Therefore I came unto your majesty.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>What you command, that rests in me to do.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>But you will take exceptions to my boon.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
</br>What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
</br>That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>But now you partly may perceive my mind.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>My mind will never grant what I perceive
</br>Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
</br>For by that loss I will not purchase them.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
</br>But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
</br>Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
</br>Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
</br>No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
</br>I am a subject fit to jest withal,
</br>But far unfit to be a sovereign.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
</br>I speak no more than what my soul intends;
</br>And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>And that is more than I will yield unto:
</br>I know I am too mean to be your queen,
</br>And yet too good to be your concubine.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
</br>
</br>LADY GREY:
</br>'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
</br>Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
</br>And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
</br>Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
</br>To be the father unto many sons.
</br>Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>To whom, my lord?
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Why, Clarence, to myself.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>By so much is the wonder in extremes.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
</br>Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
</br>
</br>Nobleman:
</br>My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
</br>And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
</br>And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
</br>To question of his apprehension.
</br>Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
</br>Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
</br>That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
</br>To cross me from the golden time I look for!
</br>And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
</br>The lustful Edward's title buried--
</br>Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
</br>And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
</br>To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
</br>A cold premeditation for my purpose!
</br>Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
</br>Like one that stands upon a promontory,
</br>And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
</br>Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
</br>And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
</br>Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
</br>So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
</br>And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
</br>And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
</br>Flattering me with impossibilities.
</br>My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
</br>Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
</br>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
</br>What other pleasure can the world afford?
</br>I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
</br>And deck my body in gay ornaments,
</br>And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
</br>O miserable thought! and more unlikely
</br>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
</br>Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
</br>And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
</br>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
</br>To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
</br>To make an envious mountain on my back,
</br>Where sits deformity to mock my body;
</br>To shape my legs of an unequal size;
</br>To disproportion me in every part,
</br>Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
</br>That carries no impression like the dam.
</br>And am I then a man to be beloved?
</br>O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
</br>Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
</br>But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
</br>As are of better person than myself,
</br>I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
</br>And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
</br>Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
</br>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
</br>And yet I know not how to get the crown,
</br>For many lives stand between me and home:
</br>And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
</br>That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
</br>Seeking a way and straying from the way;
</br>Not knowing how to find the open air,
</br>But toiling desperately to find it out,--
</br>Torment myself to catch the English crown:
</br>And from that torment I will free myself,
</br>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
</br>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
</br>And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
</br>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
</br>And frame my face to all occasions.
</br>I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
</br>I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
</br>I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
</br>Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
</br>And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
</br>I can add colours to the chameleon,
</br>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
</br>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
</br>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
</br>Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
</br>Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
</br>And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
</br>Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
</br>Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
</br>Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
</br>But now mischance hath trod my title down,
</br>And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
</br>Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
</br>And to my humble seat conform myself.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
</br>And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
</br>And sit thee by our side:
</br>Yield not thy neck
</br>To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
</br>Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
</br>Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
</br>It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
</br>And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
</br>Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
</br>That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
</br>Is of a king become a banish'd man,
</br>And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
</br>While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
</br>Usurps the regal title and the seat
</br>Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
</br>This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
</br>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
</br>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
</br>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
</br>Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
</br>Our people and our peers are both misled,
</br>Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
</br>And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
</br>While we bethink a means to break it off.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
</br>And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
</br>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
</br>My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
</br>I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
</br>First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
</br>And then to crave a league of amity;
</br>And lastly, to confirm that amity
</br>With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
</br>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
</br>To England's king in lawful marriage.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
</br>Before you answer Warwick. His demand
</br>Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
</br>But from deceit bred by necessity;
</br>For how can tyrants safely govern home,
</br>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
</br>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
</br>That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
</br>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
</br>Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
</br>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
</br>For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
</br>Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Injurious Margaret!
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>And why not queen?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Because thy father Henry did usurp;
</br>And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
</br>Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
</br>And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
</br>Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
</br>And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
</br>Who by his prowess conquered all France:
</br>From these our Henry lineally descends.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
</br>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
</br>All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
</br>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
</br>But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
</br>Of threescore and two years; a silly time
</br>To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
</br>Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
</br>And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
</br>Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
</br>For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Call him my king by whose injurious doom
</br>My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
</br>Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
</br>Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
</br>When nature brought him to the door of death?
</br>No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
</br>This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>And I the house of York.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
</br>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
</br>While I use further conference with Warwick.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
</br>Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
</br>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>But is he gracious in the people's eye?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>The more that Henry was unfortunate.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Then further, all dissembling set aside,
</br>Tell me for truth the measure of his love
</br>Unto our sister Bona.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Such it seems
</br>As may beseem a monarch like himself.
</br>Myself have often heard him say and swear
</br>That this his love was an eternal plant,
</br>Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
</br>The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
</br>Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
</br>Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
</br>
</br>BONA:
</br>Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
</br>Yet I confess that often ere this day,
</br>When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
</br>Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
</br>And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
</br>Touching the jointure that your king must make,
</br>Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
</br>Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
</br>That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>To Edward, but not to the English king.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
</br>By this alliance to make void my suit:
</br>Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>And still is friend to him and Margaret:
</br>But if your title to the crown be weak,
</br>As may appear by Edward's good success,
</br>Then 'tis but reason that I be released
</br>From giving aid which late I promised.
</br>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
</br>That your estate requires and mine can yield.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
</br>Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
</br>And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
</br>You have a father able to maintain you;
</br>And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
</br>Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
</br>I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
</br>Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
</br>Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
</br>For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
</br>Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
</br>I hope all's for the best.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
</br>And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
</br>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
</br>Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
</br>Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>I told your majesty as much before:
</br>This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
</br>And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
</br>That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
</br>No more my king, for he dishonours me,
</br>But most himself, if he could see his shame.
</br>Did I forget that by the house of York
</br>My father came untimely to his death?
</br>Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
</br>Did I impale him with the regal crown?
</br>Did I put Henry from his native right?
</br>And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
</br>Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
</br>And to repair my honour lost for him,
</br>I here renounce him and return to Henry.
</br>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
</br>And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
</br>I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
</br>And replant Henry in his former state.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
</br>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
</br>And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
</br>That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
</br>With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
</br>I'll undertake to land them on our coast
</br>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
</br>'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
</br>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
</br>He's very likely now to fall from him,
</br>For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
</br>Or than for strength and safety of our country.
</br>
</br>BONA:
</br>Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
</br>But by thy help to this distressed queen?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
</br>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
</br>
</br>BONA:
</br>My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
</br>Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
</br>You shall have aid.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Then, England's messenger, return in post,
</br>And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
</br>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
</br>To revel it with him and his new bride:
</br>Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.
</br>
</br>BONA:
</br>Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
</br>I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
</br>And I am ready to put armour on.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
</br>And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
</br>There's thy reward: be gone.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>But, Warwick,
</br>Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
</br>Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
</br>And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
</br>And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
</br>Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
</br>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>This shall assure my constant loyalty,
</br>That if our queen and this young prince agree,
</br>I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
</br>To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
</br>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
</br>Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
</br>And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
</br>That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
</br>And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.
</br>
</br>KING LEWIS XI:
</br>Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
</br>And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
</br>Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
</br>I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
</br>For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>I came from Edward as ambassador,
</br>But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
</br>Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
</br>But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
</br>Had he none else to make a stale but me?
</br>Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
</br>I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
</br>And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
</br>Not that I pity Henry's misery,
</br>But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
</br>Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
</br>Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
</br>How could he stay till Warwick made return?
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>And his well-chosen bride.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
</br>That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
</br>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
</br>That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Suppose they take offence without a cause,
</br>They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
</br>Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>And shall have your will, because our king:
</br>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Not I:
</br>No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
</br>Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
</br>To sunder them that yoke so well together.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
</br>Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
</br>Should not become my wife and England's queen.
</br>And you too, Somerset and Montague,
</br>Speak freely what you think.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
</br>Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
</br>About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
</br>Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
</br>By such invention as I can devise?
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance
</br>Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
</br>'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Why, knows not Montague that of itself
</br>England is safe, if true within itself?
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>'Tis better using France than trusting France:
</br>Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
</br>Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
</br>And with their helps only defend ourselves;
</br>In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
</br>To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
</br>And for this once my will shall stand for law.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
</br>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
</br>Unto the brother of your loving bride;
</br>She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
</br>But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
</br>Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
</br>And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
</br>That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
</br>Which being shallow, you give me leave
</br>To play the broker in mine own behalf;
</br>And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
</br>And not be tied unto his brother's will.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>My lords, before it pleased his majesty
</br>To raise my state to title of a queen,
</br>Do me but right, and you must all confess
</br>That I was not ignoble of descent;
</br>And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
</br>But as this title honours me and mine,
</br>So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
</br>Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
</br>What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
</br>So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
</br>And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
</br>Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
</br>Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
</br>Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
</br>And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now, messenger, what letters or what news
</br>From France?
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
</br>But such as I, without your special pardon,
</br>Dare not relate.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
</br>Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
</br>What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>At my depart, these were his very words:
</br>'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
</br>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
</br>To revel it with him and his new bride.'
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
</br>But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
</br>'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
</br>I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>I blame not her, she could say little less;
</br>She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
</br>For I have heard that she was there in place.
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
</br>And I am ready to put armour on.'
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
</br>But what said Warwick to these injuries?
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>He, more incensed against your majesty
</br>Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:
</br>'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
</br>And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
</br>Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
</br>They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
</br>But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
</br>friendship
</br>That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
</br>Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
</br>For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
</br>That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
</br>I may not prove inferior to yourself.
</br>You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
</br>Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
</br>And haste is needful in this desperate case.
</br>Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
</br>Go levy men, and make prepare for war;
</br>They are already, or quickly will be landed:
</br>Myself in person will straight follow you.
</br>But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
</br>Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
</br>Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
</br>Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
</br>If it be so, then both depart to him;
</br>I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
</br>But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
</br>Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
</br>That I may never have you in suspect.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>So God help Montague as he proves true!
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
</br>Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
</br>Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
</br>The common people by numbers swarm to us.
</br>But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
</br>Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Fear not that, my lord.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
</br>And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
</br>To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
</br>Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
</br>Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
</br>Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
</br>But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
</br>And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
</br>Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
</br>His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
</br>And but attended by a simple guard,
</br>We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
</br>Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
</br>That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
</br>With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
</br>And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
</br>So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
</br>At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
</br>And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
</br>For I intend but only to surprise him.
</br>You that will follow me to this attempt,
</br>Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
</br>Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:
</br>For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:
</br>The king by this is set him down to sleep.
</br>
</br>Second Watchman:
</br>What, will he not to bed?
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
</br>Never to lie and take his natural rest
</br>Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
</br>
</br>Second Watchman:
</br>To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
</br>If Warwick be so near as men report.
</br>
</br>Third Watchman:
</br>But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
</br>That with the king here resteth in his tent?
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.
</br>
</br>Third Watchman:
</br>O, is it so? But why commands the king
</br>That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
</br>While he himself keeps in the cold field?
</br>
</br>Second Watchman:
</br>'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
</br>
</br>Third Watchman:
</br>Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
</br>I like it better than a dangerous honour.
</br>If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
</br>'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
</br>
</br>Second Watchman:
</br>Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
</br>But to defend his person from night-foes?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
</br>Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
</br>But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.
</br>
</br>First Watchman:
</br>Who goes there?
</br>
</br>Second Watchman:
</br>Stay, or thou diest!
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>What are they that fly there?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
</br>Thou call'dst me king.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Ay, but the case is alter'd:
</br>When you disgraced me in my embassade,
</br>Then I degraded you from being king,
</br>And come now to create you Duke of York.
</br>Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
</br>That know not how to use ambassadors,
</br>Nor how to be contented with one wife,
</br>Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
</br>Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
</br>Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
</br>Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
</br>Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
</br>Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
</br>Edward will always bear himself as king:
</br>Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
</br>My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
</br>But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
</br>And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
</br>My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
</br>See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
</br>Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
</br>When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
</br>I'll follow you, and tell what answer
</br>Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
</br>Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
</br>It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>What now remains, my lords, for us to do
</br>But march to London with our soldiers?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
</br>To free King Henry from imprisonment
</br>And see him seated in the regal throne.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
</br>What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>No, but the loss of his own royal person.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>Then is my sovereign slain?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
</br>Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
</br>Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
</br>And, as I further have to understand,
</br>Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
</br>Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>These news I must confess are full of grief;
</br>Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
</br>Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
</br>And I the rather wean me from despair
</br>For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
</br>This is it that makes me bridle passion
</br>And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
</br>Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
</br>And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
</br>Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
</br>King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.
</br>
</br>RIVERS:
</br>But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
</br>To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
</br>Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
</br>But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
</br>For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
</br>I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
</br>To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
</br>There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
</br>Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
</br>If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
</br>Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
</br>Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
</br>Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
</br>Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
</br>He hath good usage and great liberty,
</br>And, often but attended with weak guard,
</br>Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
</br>I have advertised him by secret means
</br>That if about this hour he make his way
</br>Under the colour of his usual game,
</br>He shall here find his friends with horse and men
</br>To set him free from his captivity.
</br>
</br>Huntsman:
</br>This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
</br>Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
</br>Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
</br>Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>But whither shall we then?
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>To Lynn, my lord,
</br>And ship from thence to Flanders.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
</br>
</br>Huntsman:
</br>Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
</br>And pray that I may repossess the crown.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
</br>Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
</br>And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
</br>My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
</br>At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
</br>
</br>Lieutenant:
</br>Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
</br>But if an humble prayer may prevail,
</br>I then crave pardon of your majesty.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
</br>Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
</br>For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
</br>Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
</br>Conceive when after many moody thoughts
</br>At last by notes of household harmony
</br>They quite forget their loss of liberty.
</br>But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
</br>And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
</br>He was the author, thou the instrument.
</br>Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
</br>By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
</br>And that the people of this blessed land
</br>May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
</br>Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
</br>I here resign my government to thee,
</br>For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
</br>And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
</br>By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
</br>For few men rightly temper with the stars:
</br>Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,
</br>For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
</br>To whom the heavens in thy nativity
</br>Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
</br>As likely to be blest in peace and war;
</br>And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>And I choose Clarence only for protector.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
</br>Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
</br>That no dissension hinder government:
</br>I make you both protectors of this land,
</br>While I myself will lead a private life
</br>And in devotion spend my latter days,
</br>To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
</br>For on thy fortune I repose myself.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
</br>We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
</br>To Henry's body, and supply his place;
</br>I mean, in bearing weight of government,
</br>While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
</br>And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
</br>Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,
</br>And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>What else? and that succession be determined.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
</br>Let me entreat, for I command no more,
</br>That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
</br>Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
</br>For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
</br>My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
</br>Of whom you seem to have so tender care?
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Come hither, England's hope.
</br>If secret powers
</br>Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
</br>This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
</br>His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
</br>His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
</br>His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
</br>Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
</br>Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
</br>Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>What news, my friend?
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>That Edward is escaped from your brother,
</br>And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
</br>
</br>Post:
</br>He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
</br>And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
</br>In secret ambush on the forest side
</br>And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
</br>For hunting was his daily exercise.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>My brother was too careless of his charge.
</br>But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
</br>A salve for any sore that may betide.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
</br>For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
</br>And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
</br>As Henry's late presaging prophecy
</br>Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
</br>So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
</br>What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
</br>Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
</br>Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
</br>Till storms be past of civil enmity.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
</br>'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
</br>Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
</br>Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
</br>And says that once more I shall interchange
</br>My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
</br>Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
</br>And brought desired help from Burgundy:
</br>What then remains, we being thus arrived
</br>From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
</br>But that we enter, as into our dukedom?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
</br>For many men that stumble at the threshold
</br>Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
</br>By fair or foul means we must enter in,
</br>For hither will our friends repair to us.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
</br>
</br>Mayor:
</br>My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
</br>And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
</br>For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
</br>Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
</br>
</br>Mayor:
</br>True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
</br>As being well content with that alone.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
</br>Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
</br>
</br>Mayor:
</br>Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>The good old man would fain that all were well,
</br>So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
</br>I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
</br>Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
</br>But in the night or in the time of war.
</br>What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
</br>For Edward will defend the town and thee,
</br>And all those friends that deign to follow me.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
</br>Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>To help King Edward in his time of storm,
</br>As every loyal subject ought to do.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
</br>Our title to the crown and only claim
</br>Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
</br>I came to serve a king and not a duke.
</br>Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
</br>By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>What talk you of debating? in few words,
</br>If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
</br>I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
</br>To keep them back that come to succor you:
</br>Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
</br>Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
</br>Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:
</br>The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
</br>And Henry but usurps the diadem.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
</br>And now will I be Edward's champion.
</br>
</br>HASTINGS:
</br>Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
</br>Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.
</br>
</br>Soldier:
</br>Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
</br>England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
</br>By this I challenge him to single fight.
</br>
</br>All:
</br>Long live Edward the Fourth!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
</br>If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
</br>Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;
</br>And when the morning sun shall raise his car
</br>Above the border of this horizon,
</br>We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
</br>For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
</br>Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
</br>To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
</br>Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
</br>Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
</br>And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
</br>With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
</br>Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
</br>And with his troops doth march amain to London;
</br>And many giddy people flock to him.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>A little fire is quickly trodden out;
</br>Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
</br>Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
</br>Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
</br>Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
</br>The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
</br>Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
</br>Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
</br>Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
</br>And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,
</br>In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
</br>My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
</br>Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
</br>Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
</br>Shall rest in London till we come to him.
</br>Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
</br>Farewell, my sovereign.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
</br>And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
</br>Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
</br>Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
</br>Should not be able to encounter mine.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
</br>I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
</br>Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
</br>My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
</br>My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
</br>My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
</br>I have not been desirous of their wealth,
</br>Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.
</br>Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:
</br>Then why should they love Edward more than me?
</br>No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
</br>And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
</br>The lamb will never cease to follow him.
</br>
</br>EXETER:
</br>Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
</br>And once again proclaim us King of England.
</br>You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
</br>Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
</br>And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
</br>Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.
</br>And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
</br>Where peremptory Warwick now remains:
</br>The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
</br>Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Away betimes, before his forces join,
</br>And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
</br>Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
</br>How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?
</br>
</br>First Messenger:
</br>By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>How far off is our brother Montague?
</br>Where is the post that came from Montague?
</br>
</br>Second Messenger:
</br>By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
</br>And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
</br>And do expect him here some two hours hence.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
</br>The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
</br>Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
</br>That we could hear no news of his repair?
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
</br>Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
</br>Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
</br>And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
</br>Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
</br>Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
</br>And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
</br>Or did he make the jest against his will?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
</br>I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
</br>And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
</br>And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
</br>And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
</br>What is the body when the head is off?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
</br>But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
</br>The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
</br>You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
</br>And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.
</br>
</br>EDWARD:
</br>'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
</br>Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
</br>And with the other fling it at thy face,
</br>Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
</br>This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
</br>Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
</br>Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
</br>'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>The gates are open, let us enter too.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>So other foes may set upon our backs.
</br>Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
</br>Will issue out again and bid us battle:
</br>If not, the city being but of small defence,
</br>We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
</br>
</br>MONTAGUE:
</br>Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
</br>Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>The harder match'd, the greater victory:
</br>My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
</br>Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
</br>And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
</br>Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
</br>With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
</br>More than the nature of a brother's love!
</br>Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
</br>Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
</br>I will not ruinate my father's house,
</br>Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
</br>And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
</br>That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
</br>To bend the fatal instruments of war
</br>Against his brother and his lawful king?
</br>Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
</br>To keep that oath were more impiety
</br>Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
</br>I am so sorry for my trespass made
</br>That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
</br>I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
</br>With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
</br>As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
</br>To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
</br>And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
</br>And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
</br>Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
</br>And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
</br>For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
</br>Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
</br>Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
</br>I will away towards Barnet presently,
</br>And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
</br>Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
</br>For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
</br>Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
</br>That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
</br>And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
</br>Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
</br>My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
</br>That I must yield my body to the earth
</br>And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
</br>Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
</br>Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
</br>Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
</br>Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
</br>And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
</br>These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
</br>Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
</br>To search the secret treasons of the world:
</br>The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
</br>Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
</br>For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
</br>And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
</br>Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
</br>My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
</br>Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
</br>Is nothing left me but my body's length.
</br>Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
</br>And, live we how we can, yet die we must.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
</br>We might recover all our loss again;
</br>The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
</br>Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
</br>If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
</br>And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
</br>Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
</br>Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
</br>That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
</br>Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
</br>And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
</br>And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
</br>And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
</br>Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
</br>That mought not be distinguished; but at last
</br>I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
</br>'O, farewell, Warwick!'
</br>
</br>WARWICK:
</br>Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
</br>For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
</br>And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
</br>But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
</br>I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
</br>That will encounter with our glorious sun,
</br>Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
</br>I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
</br>Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
</br>And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
</br>And blow it to the source from whence it came:
</br>The very beams will dry those vapours up,
</br>For every cloud engenders not a storm.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
</br>And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:
</br>If she have time to breathe be well assured
</br>Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>We are advertised by our loving friends
</br>That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
</br>We, having now the best at Barnet field,
</br>Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
</br>And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
</br>In every county as we go along.
</br>Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
</br>But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
</br>What though the mast be now blown overboard,
</br>The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
</br>And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
</br>Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
</br>Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
</br>With tearful eyes add water to the sea
</br>And give more strength to that which hath too much,
</br>Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
</br>Which industry and courage might have saved?
</br>Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
</br>Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
</br>And Montague our topmost; what of him?
</br>Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
</br>Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
</br>And Somerset another goodly mast?
</br>The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
</br>And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
</br>For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
</br>We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
</br>But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
</br>From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
</br>As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
</br>And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
</br>What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
</br>And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
</br>All these the enemies to our poor bark.
</br>Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
</br>Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
</br>Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
</br>Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
</br>This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
</br>If case some one of you would fly from us,
</br>That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
</br>More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
</br>Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
</br>'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
</br>Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
</br>Infuse his breast with magnanimity
</br>And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
</br>I speak not this as doubting any here
</br>For did I but suspect a fearful man
</br>He should have leave to go away betimes,
</br>Lest in our need he might infect another
</br>And make him of like spirit to himself.
</br>If any such be here--as God forbid!--
</br>Let him depart before we need his help.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Women and children of so high a courage,
</br>And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
</br>O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
</br>Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
</br>To bear his image and renew his glories!
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>And he that will not fight for such a hope.
</br>Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
</br>If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
</br>Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>I thought no less: it is his policy
</br>To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>But he's deceived; we are in readiness.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
</br>Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
</br>Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
</br>I need not add more fuel to your fire,
</br>For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
</br>Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
</br>My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
</br>Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.
</br>Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
</br>Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,
</br>His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
</br>His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
</br>And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
</br>You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
</br>Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
</br>Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
</br>For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
</br>Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.
</br>
</br>OXFORD:
</br>For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
</br>
</br>SOMERSET:
</br>Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>So part we sadly in this troublous world,
</br>To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
</br>Shall have a high reward, and he his life?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
</br>What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
</br>Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
</br>For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
</br>And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
</br>Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
</br>Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
</br>Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
</br>Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>That you might still have worn the petticoat,
</br>And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
</br>His currish riddles sort not with this place.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
</br>
</br>PRINCE EDWARD:
</br>I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
</br>Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
</br>And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
</br>I am your better, traitors as ye are:
</br>And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>And there's for twitting me with perjury.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>O, kill me too!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Marry, and shall.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Why should she live, to fill the world with words?
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;
</br>I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
</br>Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>What? what?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>The Tower, the Tower.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
</br>Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
</br>They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
</br>Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
</br>If this foul deed were by to equal it:
</br>He was a man; this, in respect, a child:
</br>And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
</br>What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
</br>No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
</br>And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
</br>Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
</br>How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
</br>You have no children, butchers! if you had,
</br>The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
</br>But if you ever chance to have a child,
</br>Look in his youth to have him so cut off
</br>As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
</br>Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:
</br>What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:
</br>'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
</br>What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
</br>Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
</br>Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
</br>Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.
</br>
</br>QUEEN MARGARET:
</br>So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Where's Richard gone?
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
</br>To make a bloody supper in the Tower.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
</br>Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
</br>With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
</br>And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
</br>By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
</br>'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
</br>'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
</br>And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
</br>So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
</br>And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
</br>What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
</br>The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
</br>With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
</br>And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
</br>Have now the fatal object in my eye
</br>Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
</br>That taught his son the office of a fowl!
</br>An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
</br>Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
</br>The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
</br>Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
</br>Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
</br>Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
</br>My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
</br>Than can my ears that tragic history.
</br>But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Think'st thou I am an executioner?
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
</br>If murdering innocents be executing,
</br>Why, then thou art an executioner.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
</br>Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
</br>And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
</br>Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
</br>And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
</br>And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
</br>Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
</br>And orphans for their parents timeless death--
</br>Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
</br>The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
</br>The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
</br>Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
</br>The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
</br>And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
</br>Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
</br>And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
</br>To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
</br>Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
</br>Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
</br>To signify thou camest to bite the world:
</br>And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
</br>Thou camest--
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
</br>For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.
</br>
</br>KING HENRY VI:
</br>Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
</br>God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
</br>Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
</br>See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
</br>O, may such purple tears be alway shed
</br>From those that wish the downfall of our house!
</br>If any spark of life be yet remaining,
</br>Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
</br>I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
</br>Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
</br>For I have often heard my mother say
</br>I came into the world with my legs forward:
</br>Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
</br>And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
</br>The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
</br>'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
</br>And so I was; which plainly signified
</br>That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
</br>Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
</br>Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
</br>I have no brother, I am like no brother;
</br>And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
</br>Be resident in men like one another
</br>And not in me: I am myself alone.
</br>Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
</br>But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
</br>For I will buz abroad such prophecies
</br>That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
</br>And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
</br>King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
</br>Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
</br>Counting myself but bad till I be best.
</br>I'll throw thy body in another room
</br>And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
</br>3 KING HENRY VI
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
</br>Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
</br>What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
</br>Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
</br>Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
</br>For hardy and undoubted champions;
</br>Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
</br>And two Northumberlands; two braver men
</br>Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
</br>With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
</br>That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
</br>And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
</br>Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
</br>And made our footstool of security.
</br>Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
</br>Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
</br>Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
</br>Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
</br>That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
</br>And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
</br>And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>The duty that I owe unto your majesty
</br>I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.
</br>
</br>QUEEN ELIZABETH:
</br>Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
</br>
</br>GLOUCESTER:
</br>And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
</br>Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Now am I seated as my soul delights,
</br>Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.
</br>
</br>CLARENCE:
</br>What will your grace have done with Margaret?
</br>Reignier, her father, to the king of France
</br>Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
</br>And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
</br>
</br>KING EDWARD IV:
</br>Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
</br>And now what rests but that we spend the time
</br>With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
</br>Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
</br>Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
</br>For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
</br>
</br>ARCHIDAMUS:
</br>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
</br>the like occasion whereon my services are now on
</br>foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
</br>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
</br>means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
</br>
</br>ARCHIDAMUS:
</br>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
</br>justified in our loves; for indeed--
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Beseech you,--
</br>
</br>ARCHIDAMUS:
</br>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
</br>we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
</br>not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
</br>that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
</br>may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
</br>us.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
</br>
</br>ARCHIDAMUS:
</br>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
</br>and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
</br>They were trained together in their childhoods; and
</br>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
</br>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
</br>more mature dignities and royal necessities made
</br>separation of their society, their encounters,
</br>though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
</br>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
</br>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
</br>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
</br>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
</br>winds. The heavens continue their loves!
</br>
</br>ARCHIDAMUS:
</br>I think there is not in the world either malice or
</br>matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
</br>comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
</br>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
</br>into my note.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
</br>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
</br>subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
</br>crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
</br>see him a man.
</br>
</br>ARCHIDAMUS:
</br>Would they else be content to die?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
</br>desire to live.
</br>
</br>ARCHIDAMUS:
</br>If the king had no son, they would desire to live
</br>on crutches till he had one.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Nine changes of the watery star hath been
</br>The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
</br>Without a burthen: time as long again
</br>Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
</br>And yet we should, for perpetuity,
</br>Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
</br>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
</br>With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
</br>That go before it.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Stay your thanks a while;
</br>And pay them when you part.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Sir, that's to-morrow.
</br>I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
</br>Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
</br>No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
</br>'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
</br>To tire your royalty.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>We are tougher, brother,
</br>Than you can put us to't.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>No longer stay.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>One seven-night longer.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Very sooth, to-morrow.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>We'll part the time between's then; and in that
</br>I'll no gainsaying.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Press me not, beseech you, so.
</br>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
</br>So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
</br>Were there necessity in your request, although
</br>'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
</br>Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
</br>Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
</br>To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
</br>Farewell, our brother.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Tongue-tied, our queen?
</br>speak you.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
</br>You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
</br>Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
</br>All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
</br>The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
</br>He's beat from his best ward.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Well said, Hermione.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
</br>But let him say so then, and let him go;
</br>But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
</br>We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
</br>Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
</br>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
</br>You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
</br>To let him there a month behind the gest
</br>Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
</br>I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
</br>What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>No, madam.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Nay, but you will?
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>I may not, verily.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Verily!
</br>You put me off with limber vows; but I,
</br>Though you would seek to unsphere the
</br>stars with oaths,
</br>Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
</br>You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
</br>As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
</br>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
</br>Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
</br>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
</br>My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
</br>One of them you shall be.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Your guest, then, madam:
</br>To be your prisoner should import offending;
</br>Which is for me less easy to commit
</br>Than you to punish.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Not your gaoler, then,
</br>But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
</br>Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
</br>You were pretty lordings then?
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>We were, fair queen,
</br>Two lads that thought there was no more behind
</br>But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
</br>And to be boy eternal.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Was not my lord
</br>The verier wag o' the two?
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
</br>And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
</br>Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
</br>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
</br>That any did. Had we pursued that life,
</br>And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
</br>With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
</br>Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
</br>Hereditary ours.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>By this we gather
</br>You have tripp'd since.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>O my most sacred lady!
</br>Temptations have since then been born to's; for
</br>In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
</br>Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
</br>Of my young play-fellow.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Grace to boot!
</br>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
</br>Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
</br>The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
</br>If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
</br>You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
</br>With any but with us.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Is he won yet?
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>He'll stay my lord.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>At my request he would not.
</br>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
</br>To better purpose.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Never?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Never, but once.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
</br>I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
</br>As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
</br>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
</br>Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
</br>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
</br>With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
</br>My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
</br>What was my first? it has an elder sister,
</br>Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
</br>But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
</br>Nay, let me have't; I long.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Why, that was when
</br>Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
</br>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
</br>And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
</br>'I am yours for ever.'
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>'Tis grace indeed.
</br>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
</br>The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
</br>The other for some while a friend.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>Ay, my good lord.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>I' fecks!
</br>Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
</br>smutch'd thy nose?
</br>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
</br>We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
</br>And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
</br>Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
</br>Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
</br>Art thou my calf?
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>Yes, if you will, my lord.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
</br>To be full like me: yet they say we are
</br>Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
</br>That will say anything but were they false
</br>As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
</br>As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
</br>No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
</br>To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
</br>Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
</br>Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
</br>Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
</br>Thou dost make possible things not so held,
</br>Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
</br>With what's unreal thou coactive art,
</br>And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
</br>Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
</br>And that beyond commission, and I find it,
</br>And that to the infection of my brains
</br>And hardening of my brows.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>What means Sicilia?
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>He something seems unsettled.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>How, my lord!
</br>What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
</br>Are you moved, my lord?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>No, in good earnest.
</br>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
</br>Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
</br>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
</br>Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
</br>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
</br>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
</br>Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
</br>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
</br>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
</br>This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
</br>Will you take eggs for money?
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>No, my lord, I'll fight.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
</br>Are you so fond of your young prince as we
</br>Do seem to be of ours?
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>If at home, sir,
</br>He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
</br>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
</br>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
</br>He makes a July's day short as December,
</br>And with his varying childness cures in me
</br>Thoughts that would thick my blood.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>So stands this squire
</br>Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
</br>And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
</br>How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
</br>Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
</br>Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
</br>Apparent to my heart.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>If you would seek us,
</br>We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
</br>Be you beneath the sky.
</br>I am angling now,
</br>Though you perceive me not how I give line.
</br>Go to, go to!
</br>How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
</br>And arms her with the boldness of a wife
</br>To her allowing husband!
</br>Gone already!
</br>Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
</br>ears a fork'd one!
</br>Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
</br>Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
</br>Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
</br>Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
</br>There have been,
</br>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
</br>And many a man there is, even at this present,
</br>Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
</br>That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
</br>And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
</br>Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
</br>Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
</br>As mine, against their will. Should all despair
</br>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
</br>Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
</br>It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
</br>Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
</br>From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
</br>No barricado for a belly; know't;
</br>It will let in and out the enemy
</br>With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
</br>Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>I am like you, they say.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Ay, my good lord.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
</br>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
</br>When you cast out, it still came home.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Didst note it?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>He would not stay at your petitions: made
</br>His business more material.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Didst perceive it?
</br>They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
</br>'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
</br>When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
</br>That he did stay?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>At the good queen's entreaty.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
</br>But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
</br>By any understanding pate but thine?
</br>For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
</br>More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
</br>But of the finer natures? by some severals
</br>Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
</br>Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Business, my lord! I think most understand
</br>Bohemia stays here longer.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Ha!
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Stays here longer.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Ay, but why?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
</br>Of our most gracious mistress.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Satisfy!
</br>The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
</br>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
</br>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
</br>My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
</br>Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
</br>Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
</br>Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
</br>In that which seems so.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Be it forbid, my lord!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
</br>If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
</br>Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
</br>From course required; or else thou must be counted
</br>A servant grafted in my serious trust
</br>And therein negligent; or else a fool
</br>That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
</br>And takest it all for jest.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>My gracious lord,
</br>I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
</br>In every one of these no man is free,
</br>But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
</br>Among the infinite doings of the world,
</br>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
</br>If ever I were wilful-negligent,
</br>It was my folly; if industriously
</br>I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
</br>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
</br>To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
</br>Where of the execution did cry out
</br>Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
</br>Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
</br>Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
</br>Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
</br>Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
</br>By its own visage: if I then deny it,
</br>'Tis none of mine.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
</br>But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
</br>Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
</br>For to a vision so apparent rumour
</br>Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
</br>Resides not in that man that does not think,--
</br>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
</br>Or else be impudently negative,
</br>To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
</br>My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
</br>As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
</br>Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I would not be a stander-by to hear
</br>My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
</br>My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
</br>You never spoke what did become you less
</br>Than this; which to reiterate were sin
</br>As deep as that, though true.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Is whispering nothing?
</br>Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
</br>Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
</br>Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
</br>Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
</br>Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
</br>Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
</br>Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
</br>That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
</br>Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
</br>The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
</br>My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
</br>If this be nothing.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Good my lord, be cured
</br>Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
</br>For 'tis most dangerous.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Say it be, 'tis true.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>No, no, my lord.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>It is; you lie, you lie:
</br>I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
</br>Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
</br>Or else a hovering temporizer, that
</br>Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
</br>Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
</br>Infected as her life, she would not live
</br>The running of one glass.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Who does infect her?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
</br>About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
</br>Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
</br>To see alike mine honour as their profits,
</br>Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
</br>Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
</br>His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
</br>Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
</br>Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
</br>How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
</br>To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
</br>Which draught to me were cordial.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Sir, my lord,
</br>I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
</br>But with a lingering dram that should not work
</br>Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
</br>Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
</br>So sovereignly being honourable.
</br>I have loved thee,--
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Make that thy question, and go rot!
</br>Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
</br>To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
</br>The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
</br>Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
</br>Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
</br>Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
</br>Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
</br>Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
</br>Could man so blench?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I must believe you, sir:
</br>I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
</br>Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
</br>Will take again your queen as yours at first,
</br>Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
</br>The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
</br>Known and allied to yours.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Thou dost advise me
</br>Even so as I mine own course have set down:
</br>I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>My lord,
</br>Go then; and with a countenance as clear
</br>As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
</br>And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
</br>If from me he have wholesome beverage,
</br>Account me not your servant.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>This is all:
</br>Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
</br>Do't not, thou split'st thine own.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I'll do't, my lord.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>O miserable lady! But, for me,
</br>What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
</br>Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
</br>Is the obedience to a master, one
</br>Who in rebellion with himself will have
</br>All that are his so too. To do this deed,
</br>Promotion follows. If I could find example
</br>Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
</br>And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
</br>Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
</br>Let villany itself forswear't. I must
</br>Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
</br>To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
</br>Here comes Bohemia.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>This is strange: methinks
</br>My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
</br>Good day, Camillo.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Hail, most royal sir!
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>What is the news i' the court?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>None rare, my lord.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>The king hath on him such a countenance
</br>As he had lost some province and a region
</br>Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
</br>With customary compliment; when he,
</br>Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
</br>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
</br>So leaves me to consider what is breeding
</br>That changeth thus his manners.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I dare not know, my lord.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
</br>Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
</br>For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
</br>And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
</br>Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
</br>Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
</br>A party in this alteration, finding
</br>Myself thus alter'd with 't.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>There is a sickness
</br>Which puts some of us in distemper, but
</br>I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
</br>Of you that yet are well.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>How! caught of me!
</br>Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
</br>I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
</br>By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
</br>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
</br>Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
</br>Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
</br>In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
</br>If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
</br>Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
</br>In ignorant concealment.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I may not answer.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
</br>I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
</br>I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
</br>Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
</br>Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
</br>What incidency thou dost guess of harm
</br>Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
</br>Which way to be prevented, if to be;
</br>If not, how best to bear it.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Sir, I will tell you;
</br>Since I am charged in honour and by him
</br>That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
</br>Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
</br>I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
</br>Cry lost, and so good night!
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>On, good Camillo.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I am appointed him to murder you.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>By whom, Camillo?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>By the king.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>For what?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
</br>As he had seen't or been an instrument
</br>To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
</br>Forbiddenly.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>O, then my best blood turn
</br>To an infected jelly and my name
</br>Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
</br>Turn then my freshest reputation to
</br>A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
</br>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
</br>Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
</br>That e'er was heard or read!
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Swear his thought over
</br>By each particular star in heaven and
</br>By all their influences, you may as well
</br>Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
</br>As or by oath remove or counsel shake
</br>The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
</br>Is piled upon his faith and will continue
</br>The standing of his body.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>How should this grow?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
</br>Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
</br>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
</br>That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
</br>Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
</br>Your followers I will whisper to the business,
</br>And will by twos and threes at several posterns
</br>Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
</br>My fortunes to your service, which are here
</br>By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
</br>For, by the honour of my parents, I
</br>Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
</br>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
</br>Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
</br>His execution sworn.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>I do believe thee:
</br>I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
</br>Be pilot to me and thy places shall
</br>Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
</br>My people did expect my hence departure
</br>Two days ago. This jealousy
</br>Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
</br>Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
</br>Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
</br>He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
</br>Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
</br>In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
</br>Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
</br>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
</br>Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
</br>I will respect thee as a father if
</br>Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>It is in mine authority to command
</br>The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
</br>To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
</br>'Tis past enduring.
</br>
</br>First Lady:
</br>Come, my gracious lord,
</br>Shall I be your playfellow?
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>No, I'll none of you.
</br>
</br>First Lady:
</br>Why, my sweet lord?
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
</br>I were a baby still. I love you better.
</br>
</br>Second Lady:
</br>And why so, my lord?
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>Not for because
</br>Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
</br>Become some women best, so that there be not
</br>Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
</br>Or a half-moon made with a pen.
</br>
</br>Second Lady:
</br>Who taught you this?
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
</br>What colour are your eyebrows?
</br>
</br>First Lady:
</br>Blue, my lord.
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
</br>That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
</br>
</br>First Lady:
</br>Hark ye;
</br>The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
</br>Present our services to a fine new prince
</br>One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
</br>If we would have you.
</br>
</br>Second Lady:
</br>She is spread of late
</br>Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
</br>I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
</br>And tell 's a tale.
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>Merry or sad shall't be?
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>As merry as you will.
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
</br>Of sprites and goblins.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Let's have that, good sir.
</br>Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
</br>To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>There was a man--
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Nay, come, sit down; then on.
</br>
</br>MAMILLIUS:
</br>Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
</br>Yond crickets shall not hear it.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Come on, then,
</br>And give't me in mine ear.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
</br>Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
</br>Even to their ships.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>How blest am I
</br>In my just censure, in my true opinion!
</br>Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
</br>In being so blest! There may be in the cup
</br>A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
</br>And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
</br>Is not infected: but if one present
</br>The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
</br>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
</br>With violent hefts. I have drunk,
</br>and seen the spider.
</br>Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
</br>There is a plot against my life, my crown;
</br>All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
</br>Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
</br>He has discover'd my design, and I
</br>Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
</br>For them to play at will. How came the posterns
</br>So easily open?
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>By his great authority;
</br>Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
</br>On your command.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>I know't too well.
</br>Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
</br>Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
</br>Have too much blood in him.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>What is this? sport?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
</br>Away with him! and let her sport herself
</br>With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
</br>Has made thee swell thus.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>But I'ld say he had not,
</br>And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
</br>Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>You, my lords,
</br>Look on her, mark her well; be but about
</br>To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
</br>The justice of your bearts will thereto add
</br>'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
</br>Praise her but for this her without-door form,
</br>Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
</br>The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
</br>That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
</br>That mercy does, for calumny will sear
</br>Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
</br>When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
</br>Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
</br>From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
</br>She's an adulteress.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Should a villain say so,
</br>The most replenish'd villain in the world,
</br>He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
</br>Do but mistake.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>You have mistook, my lady,
</br>Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
</br>Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
</br>Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
</br>Should a like language use to all degrees
</br>And mannerly distinguishment leave out
</br>Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
</br>She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
</br>More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
</br>A federary with her, and one that knows
</br>What she should shame to know herself
</br>But with her most vile principal, that she's
</br>A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
</br>That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
</br>To this their late escape.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>No, by my life.
</br>Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
</br>When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
</br>You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
</br>You scarce can right me throughly then to say
</br>You did mistake.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>No; if I mistake
</br>In those foundations which I build upon,
</br>The centre is not big enough to bear
</br>A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
</br>He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
</br>But that he speaks.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>There's some ill planet reigns:
</br>I must be patient till the heavens look
</br>With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
</br>I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
</br>Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
</br>Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
</br>That honourable grief lodged here which burns
</br>Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
</br>With thoughts so qualified as your charities
</br>Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
</br>The king's will be perform'd!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Shall I be heard?
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
</br>My women may be with me; for you see
</br>My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
</br>There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
</br>Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
</br>As I come out: this action I now go on
</br>Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
</br>I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
</br>I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Go, do our bidding; hence!
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
</br>Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
</br>Yourself, your queen, your son.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>For her, my lord,
</br>I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
</br>Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
</br>I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
</br>In this which you accuse her.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>If it prove
</br>She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
</br>I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
</br>Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
</br>For every inch of woman in the world,
</br>Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Hold your peaces.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>Good my lord,--
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
</br>You are abused and by some putter-on
</br>That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
</br>I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
</br>I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
</br>The second and the third, nine, and some five;
</br>If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
</br>by mine honour,
</br>I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
</br>To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
</br>And I had rather glib myself than they
</br>Should not produce fair issue.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Cease; no more.
</br>You smell this business with a sense as cold
</br>As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
</br>As you feel doing thus; and see withal
</br>The instruments that feel.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>If it be so,
</br>We need no grave to bury honesty:
</br>There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
</br>Of the whole dungy earth.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>What! lack I credit?
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
</br>Upon this ground; and more it would content me
</br>To have her honour true than your suspicion,
</br>Be blamed for't how you might.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Why, what need we
</br>Commune with you of this, but rather follow
</br>Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
</br>Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
</br>Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
</br>Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
</br>Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
</br>We need no more of your advice: the matter,
</br>The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
</br>Properly ours.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>And I wish, my liege,
</br>You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
</br>Without more overture.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>How could that be?
</br>Either thou art most ignorant by age,
</br>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
</br>Added to their familiarity,
</br>Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
</br>That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
</br>But only seeing, all other circumstances
</br>Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
</br>Yet, for a greater confirmation,
</br>For in an act of this importance 'twere
</br>Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
</br>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
</br>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
</br>Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
</br>They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
</br>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>Well done, my lord.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Though I am satisfied and need no more
</br>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
</br>Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
</br>Whose ignorant credulity will not
</br>Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
</br>From our free person she should be confined,
</br>Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
</br>Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
</br>We are to speak in public; for this business
</br>Will raise us all.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>The keeper of the prison, call to him;
</br>let him have knowledge who I am.
</br>Good lady,
</br>No court in Europe is too good for thee;
</br>What dost thou then in prison?
</br>Now, good sir,
</br>You know me, do you not?
</br>
</br>Gaoler:
</br>For a worthy lady
</br>And one whom much I honour.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Pray you then,
</br>Conduct me to the queen.
</br>
</br>Gaoler:
</br>I may not, madam:
</br>To the contrary I have express commandment.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Here's ado,
</br>To lock up honesty and honour from
</br>The access of gentle visitors!
</br>Is't lawful, pray you,
</br>To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
</br>
</br>Gaoler:
</br>So please you, madam,
</br>To put apart these your attendants, I
</br>Shall bring Emilia forth.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I pray now, call her.
</br>Withdraw yourselves.
</br>
</br>Gaoler:
</br>And, madam,
</br>I must be present at your conference.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Well, be't so, prithee.
</br>Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
</br>As passes colouring.
</br>Dear gentlewoman,
</br>How fares our gracious lady?
</br>
</br>EMILIA:
</br>As well as one so great and so forlorn
</br>May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
</br>Which never tender lady hath born greater,
</br>She is something before her time deliver'd.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>A boy?
</br>
</br>EMILIA:
</br>A daughter, and a goodly babe,
</br>Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
</br>Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
</br>I am innocent as you.'
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I dare be sworn
</br>These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
</br>beshrew them!
</br>He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
</br>Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
</br>If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
</br>And never to my red-look'd anger be
</br>The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
</br>Commend my best obedience to the queen:
</br>If she dares trust me with her little babe,
</br>I'll show't the king and undertake to be
</br>Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
</br>How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
</br>The silence often of pure innocence
</br>Persuades when speaking fails.
</br>
</br>EMILIA:
</br>Most worthy madam,
</br>Your honour and your goodness is so evident
</br>That your free undertaking cannot miss
</br>A thriving issue: there is no lady living
</br>So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
</br>To visit the next room, I'll presently
</br>Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
</br>Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
</br>But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
</br>Lest she should be denied.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Tell her, Emilia.
</br>I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
</br>As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
</br>I shall do good.
</br>
</br>EMILIA:
</br>Now be you blest for it!
</br>I'll to the queen: please you,
</br>come something nearer.
</br>
</br>Gaoler:
</br>Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
</br>I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
</br>Having no warrant.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>You need not fear it, sir:
</br>This child was prisoner to the womb and is
</br>By law and process of great nature thence
</br>Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
</br>The anger of the king nor guilty of,
</br>If any be, the trespass of the queen.
</br>
</br>Gaoler:
</br>I do believe it.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
</br>I will stand betwixt you and danger.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
</br>To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
</br>The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
</br>She the adulteress; for the harlot king
</br>Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
</br>And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
</br>I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
</br>Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
</br>Might come to me again. Who's there?
</br>
</br>First Servant:
</br>My lord?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>How does the boy?
</br>
</br>First Servant:
</br>He took good rest to-night;
</br>'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>To see his nobleness!
</br>Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
</br>He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
</br>Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
</br>Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
</br>And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
</br>See how he fares.
</br>Fie, fie! no thought of him:
</br>The thought of my revenges that way
</br>Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
</br>And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
</br>Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
</br>Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
</br>Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
</br>They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
</br>Shall she within my power.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>You must not enter.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
</br>Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
</br>Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
</br>More free than he is jealous.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>That's enough.
</br>
</br>Second Servant:
</br>Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
</br>None should come at him.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Not so hot, good sir:
</br>I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
</br>That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
</br>At each his needless heavings, such as you
</br>Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
</br>Do come with words as medicinal as true,
</br>Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
</br>That presses him from sleep.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>What noise there, ho?
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>No noise, my lord; but needful conference
</br>About some gossips for your highness.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>How!
</br>Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
</br>I charged thee that she should not come about me:
</br>I knew she would.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>I told her so, my lord,
</br>On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
</br>She should not visit you.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>What, canst not rule her?
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>From all dishonesty he can: in this,
</br>Unless he take the course that you have done,
</br>Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
</br>He shall not rule me.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>La you now, you hear:
</br>When she will take the rein I let her run;
</br>But she'll not stumble.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Good my liege, I come;
</br>And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
</br>Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
</br>Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
</br>Less appear so in comforting your evils,
</br>Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
</br>From your good queen.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Good queen!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Good queen, my lord,
</br>Good queen; I say good queen;
</br>And would by combat make her good, so were I
</br>A man, the worst about you.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Force her hence.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
</br>First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
</br>But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
</br>For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
</br>Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Out!
</br>A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
</br>A most intelligencing bawd!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Not so:
</br>I am as ignorant in that as you
</br>In so entitling me, and no less honest
</br>Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
</br>As this world goes, to pass for honest.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Traitors!
</br>Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
</br>Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
</br>By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
</br>Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>For ever
</br>Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
</br>Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
</br>Which he has put upon't!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>He dreads his wife.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
</br>You'ld call your children yours.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>A nest of traitors!
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>I am none, by this good light.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Nor I, nor any
</br>But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
</br>The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
</br>His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
</br>Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
</br>and will not--
</br>For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
</br>He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
</br>The root of his opinion, which is rotten
</br>As ever oak or stone was sound.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>A callat
</br>Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
</br>And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
</br>It is the issue of Polixenes:
</br>Hence with it, and together with the dam
</br>Commit them to the fire!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>It is yours;
</br>And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
</br>So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
</br>Although the print be little, the whole matter
</br>And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
</br>The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
</br>The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
</br>His smiles,
</br>The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
</br>And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
</br>So like to him that got it, if thou hast
</br>The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
</br>No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
</br>Her children not her husband's!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>A gross hag
</br>And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
</br>That wilt not stay her tongue.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>Hang all the husbands
</br>That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
</br>Hardly one subject.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Once more, take her hence.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>A most unworthy and unnatural lord
</br>Can do no more.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>I'll ha' thee burnt.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I care not:
</br>It is an heretic that makes the fire,
</br>Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
</br>But this most cruel usage of your queen,
</br>Not able to produce more accusation
</br>Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
</br>Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
</br>Yea, scandalous to the world.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>On your allegiance,
</br>Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
</br>Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
</br>If she did know me one. Away with her!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
</br>Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
</br>Jove send her
</br>A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
</br>You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
</br>Will never do him good, not one of you.
</br>So, so: farewell; we are gone.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
</br>My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
</br>A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
</br>And see it instantly consumed with fire;
</br>Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
</br>Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
</br>And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
</br>With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
</br>And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
</br>The bastard brains with these my proper hands
</br>Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
</br>For thou set'st on thy wife.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>I did not, sir:
</br>These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
</br>Can clear me in't.
</br>
</br>Lords:
</br>We can: my royal liege,
</br>He is not guilty of her coming hither.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>You're liars all.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
</br>We have always truly served you, and beseech you
</br>So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
</br>As recompense of our dear services
</br>Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
</br>Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
</br>Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>I am a feather for each wind that blows:
</br>Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
</br>And call me father? better burn it now
</br>Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
</br>It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
</br>You that have been so tenderly officious
</br>With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
</br>To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
</br>So sure as this beard's grey,
</br>--what will you adventure
</br>To save this brat's life?
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>Any thing, my lord,
</br>That my ability may undergo
</br>And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
</br>I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
</br>To save the innocent: any thing possible.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
</br>Thou wilt perform my bidding.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>I will, my lord.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
</br>Of any point in't shall not only be
</br>Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
</br>Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
</br>As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
</br>This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
</br>To some remote and desert place quite out
</br>Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
</br>Without more mercy, to its own protection
</br>And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
</br>It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
</br>On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
</br>That thou commend it strangely to some place
</br>Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>I swear to do this, though a present death
</br>Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
</br>Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
</br>To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
</br>Casting their savageness aside have done
</br>Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
</br>In more than this deed does require! And blessing
</br>Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
</br>Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>No, I'll not rear
</br>Another's issue.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Please your highness, posts
</br>From those you sent to the oracle are come
</br>An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
</br>Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
</br>Hasting to the court.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>So please you, sir, their speed
</br>Hath been beyond account.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Twenty-three days
</br>They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
</br>The great Apollo suddenly will have
</br>The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
</br>Summon a session, that we may arraign
</br>Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
</br>Been publicly accused, so shall she have
</br>A just and open trial. While she lives
</br>My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
</br>And think upon my bidding.
</br>
</br>CLEOMENES:
</br>The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
</br>Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
</br>The common praise it bears.
</br>
</br>DION:
</br>I shall report,
</br>For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
</br>Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
</br>Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
</br>How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
</br>It was i' the offering!
</br>
</br>CLEOMENES:
</br>But of all, the burst
</br>And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
</br>Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
</br>That I was nothing.
</br>
</br>DION:
</br>If the event o' the journey
</br>Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
</br>As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
</br>The time is worth the use on't.
</br>
</br>CLEOMENES:
</br>Great Apollo
</br>Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
</br>So forcing faults upon Hermione,
</br>I little like.
</br>
</br>DION:
</br>The violent carriage of it
</br>Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
</br>Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
</br>Shall the contents discover, something rare
</br>Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
</br>And gracious be the issue!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
</br>Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
</br>The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
</br>Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
</br>Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
</br>Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
</br>Even to the guilt or the purgation.
</br>Produce the prisoner.
</br>
</br>Officer:
</br>It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
</br>Appear in person here in court. Silence!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Read the indictment.
</br>
</br>Officer:
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Since what I am to say must be but that
</br>Which contradicts my accusation and
</br>The testimony on my part no other
</br>But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
</br>To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
</br>Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
</br>Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
</br>Behold our human actions, as they do,
</br>I doubt not then but innocence shall make
</br>False accusation blush and tyranny
</br>Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
</br>Who least will seem to do so, my past life
</br>Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
</br>As I am now unhappy; which is more
</br>Than history can pattern, though devised
</br>And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
</br>A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
</br>A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
</br>The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
</br>To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
</br>Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
</br>As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
</br>'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
</br>And only that I stand for. I appeal
</br>To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
</br>Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
</br>How merited to be so; since he came,
</br>With what encounter so uncurrent I
</br>Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
</br>The bound of honour, or in act or will
</br>That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
</br>Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
</br>Cry fie upon my grave!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>I ne'er heard yet
</br>That any of these bolder vices wanted
</br>Less impudence to gainsay what they did
</br>Than to perform it first.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>That's true enough;
</br>Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>You will not own it.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>More than mistress of
</br>Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
</br>At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
</br>With whom I am accused, I do confess
</br>I loved him as in honour he required,
</br>With such a kind of love as might become
</br>A lady like me, with a love even such,
</br>So and no other, as yourself commanded:
</br>Which not to have done I think had been in me
</br>Both disobedience and ingratitude
</br>To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
</br>Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
</br>That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
</br>I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
</br>For me to try how: all I know of it
</br>Is that Camillo was an honest man;
</br>And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
</br>Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>You knew of his departure, as you know
</br>What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Sir,
</br>You speak a language that I understand not:
</br>My life stands in the level of your dreams,
</br>Which I'll lay down.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Your actions are my dreams;
</br>You had a bastard by Polixenes,
</br>And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
</br>Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
</br>Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
</br>Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
</br>No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
</br>More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
</br>Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
</br>Look for no less than death.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Sir, spare your threats:
</br>The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
</br>To me can life be no commodity:
</br>The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
</br>I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
</br>But know not how it went. My second joy
</br>And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
</br>I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
</br>Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
</br>The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
</br>Haled out to murder: myself on every post
</br>Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
</br>The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
</br>To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
</br>Here to this place, i' the open air, before
</br>I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
</br>Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
</br>That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
</br>But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
</br>I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
</br>Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
</br>Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
</br>But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
</br>'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
</br>I do refer me to the oracle:
</br>Apollo be my judge!
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>This your request
</br>Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
</br>And in Apollos name, his oracle.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>The Emperor of Russia was my father:
</br>O that he were alive, and here beholding
</br>His daughter's trial! that he did but see
</br>The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
</br>Of pity, not revenge!
</br>
</br>Officer:
</br>You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
</br>That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
</br>Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
</br>The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
</br>Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
</br>You have not dared to break the holy seal
</br>Nor read the secrets in't.
</br>
</br>CLEOMENES:
</br>All this we swear.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Break up the seals and read.
</br>
</br>Officer:
</br>
</br>Lords:
</br>Now blessed be the great Apollo!
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>Praised!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Hast thou read truth?
</br>
</br>Officer:
</br>Ay, my lord; even so
</br>As it is here set down.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
</br>The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>My lord the king, the king!
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>What is the business?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
</br>The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
</br>Of the queen's speed, is gone.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>How! gone!
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Is dead.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
</br>Do strike at my injustice.
</br>How now there!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>This news is mortal to the queen: look down
</br>And see what death is doing.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Take her hence:
</br>Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
</br>I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
</br>Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
</br>Some remedies for life.
</br>Apollo, pardon
</br>My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
</br>I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
</br>New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
</br>Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
</br>For, being transported by my jealousies
</br>To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
</br>Camillo for the minister to poison
</br>My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
</br>But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
</br>My swift command, though I with death and with
</br>Reward did threaten and encourage him,
</br>Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
</br>And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
</br>Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
</br>Which you knew great, and to the hazard
</br>Of all encertainties himself commended,
</br>No richer than his honour: how he glisters
</br>Thorough my rust! and how his pity
</br>Does my deeds make the blacker!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Woe the while!
</br>O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
</br>Break too.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>What fit is this, good lady?
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
</br>What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
</br>In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
</br>Must I receive, whose every word deserves
</br>To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
</br>Together working with thy jealousies,
</br>Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
</br>For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
</br>And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
</br>Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
</br>That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
</br>That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
</br>And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
</br>Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
</br>To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
</br>More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
</br>The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
</br>To be or none or little; though a devil
</br>Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
</br>Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
</br>Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
</br>Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
</br>That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
</br>Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
</br>Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
</br>When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
</br>The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
</br>and vengeance for't
</br>Not dropp'd down yet.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>The higher powers forbid!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
</br>Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
</br>Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
</br>Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
</br>As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
</br>Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
</br>Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
</br>To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
</br>Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
</br>Upon a barren mountain and still winter
</br>In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
</br>To look that way thou wert.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Go on, go on
</br>Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
</br>All tongues to talk their bitterest.
</br>
</br>First Lord:
</br>Say no more:
</br>Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
</br>I' the boldness of your speech.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I am sorry for't:
</br>All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
</br>I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
</br>The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
</br>To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
</br>Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
</br>At my petition; I beseech you, rather
</br>Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
</br>Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
</br>Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
</br>The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
</br>I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
</br>I'll not remember you of my own lord,
</br>Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
</br>And I'll say nothing.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Thou didst speak but well
</br>When most the truth; which I receive much better
</br>Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
</br>To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
</br>One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
</br>The causes of their death appear, unto
</br>Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
</br>The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
</br>Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
</br>Will bear up with this exercise, so long
</br>I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
</br>Unto these sorrows.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
</br>The deserts of Bohemia?
</br>
</br>Mariner:
</br>Ay, my lord: and fear
</br>We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
</br>And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
</br>The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
</br>And frown upon 's.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
</br>Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
</br>I call upon thee.
</br>
</br>Mariner:
</br>Make your best haste, and go not
</br>Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
</br>Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
</br>Of prey that keep upon't.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>Go thou away:
</br>I'll follow instantly.
</br>
</br>Mariner:
</br>I am glad at heart
</br>To be so rid o' the business.
</br>
</br>ANTIGONUS:
</br>Come, poor babe:
</br>I have heard, but not believed,
</br>the spirits o' the dead
</br>May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
</br>Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
</br>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
</br>Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
</br>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
</br>So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
</br>Like very sanctity, she did approach
</br>My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
</br>And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
</br>Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
</br>Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
</br>Since fate, against thy better disposition,
</br>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
</br>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
</br>Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
</br>There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
</br>Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
</br>I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
</br>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
</br>Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
</br>She melted into air. Affrighted much,
</br>I did in time collect myself and thought
</br>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
</br>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
</br>I will be squared by this. I do believe
</br>Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
</br>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
</br>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
</br>Either for life or death, upon the earth
</br>Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
</br>There lie, and there thy character: there these;
</br>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
</br>And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
</br>That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
</br>To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
</br>But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
</br>To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
</br>The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
</br>A lullaby too rough: I never saw
</br>The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
</br>Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
</br>I am gone for ever.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>I would there were no age between sixteen and
</br>three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
</br>rest; for there is nothing in the between but
</br>getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
</br>stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
</br>these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
</br>hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
</br>best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
</br>than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
</br>the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
</br>will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
</br>pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
</br>pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
</br>though I am not bookish, yet I can read
</br>waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
</br>some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
</br>behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
</br>than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
</br>pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
</br>but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Hilloa, loa!
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
</br>on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
</br>ailest thou, man?
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
</br>but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
</br>sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
</br>a bodkin's point.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Why, boy, how is it?
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
</br>how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
</br>point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
</br>sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
</br>ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
</br>swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
</br>cork into a hogshead. And then for the
</br>land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
</br>shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
</br>his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
</br>end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
</br>it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
</br>sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
</br>and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
</br>the sea or weather.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
</br>sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
</br>the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
</br>now.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>I would you had been by the ship side, to have
</br>helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
</br>boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
</br>dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
</br>thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
</br>child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
</br>open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
</br>rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
</br>open't. What's within, boy?
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
</br>are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
</br>with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
</br>We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
</br>nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
</br>boy, the next way home.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
</br>if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
</br>he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
</br>are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
</br>it.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
</br>which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
</br>sight of him.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.
</br>
</br>Time:
</br>I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
</br>Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
</br>Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
</br>To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
</br>To me or my swift passage, that I slide
</br>O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
</br>Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
</br>To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
</br>To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
</br>The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
</br>Or what is now received: I witness to
</br>The times that brought them in; so shall I do
</br>To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
</br>The glistering of this present, as my tale
</br>Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
</br>I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
</br>As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
</br>The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
</br>That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
</br>Gentle spectators, that I now may be
</br>In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
</br>I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
</br>I now name to you; and with speed so pace
</br>To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
</br>Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
</br>I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
</br>Be known when 'tis brought forth.
</br>A shepherd's daughter,
</br>And what to her adheres, which follows after,
</br>Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
</br>If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
</br>If never, yet that Time himself doth say
</br>He wishes earnestly you never may.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
</br>'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
</br>grant this.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
</br>I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
</br>desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
</br>king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
</br>sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
</br>think so, which is another spur to my departure.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
</br>thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
</br>thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
</br>have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
</br>made me businesses which none without thee can
</br>sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
</br>them thyself or take away with thee the very
</br>services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
</br>considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
</br>thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
</br>therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
</br>country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
</br>naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
</br>penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
</br>my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
</br>and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
</br>Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
</br>son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
</br>being gracious, than they are in losing them when
</br>they have approved their virtues.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
</br>his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
</br>have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
</br>from court and is less frequent to his princely
</br>exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
</br>care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
</br>look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
</br>intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
</br>most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
</br>very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
</br>neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
</br>daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
</br>extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
</br>fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
</br>shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
</br>appearing what we are, have some question with the
</br>shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
</br>uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
</br>Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
</br>lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I willingly obey your command.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>When daffodils begin to peer,
</br>With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
</br>Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
</br>For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
</br>The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
</br>With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
</br>Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
</br>For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
</br>The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
</br>With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
</br>Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
</br>While we lie tumbling in the hay.
</br>I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
</br>wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
</br>But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
</br>The pale moon shines by night:
</br>And when I wander here and there,
</br>I then do most go right.
</br>If tinkers may have leave to live,
</br>And bear the sow-skin budget,
</br>Then my account I well may, give,
</br>And in the stocks avouch it.
</br>My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
</br>lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
</br>being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
</br>a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
</br>drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
</br>the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
</br>on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
</br>me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
</br>of it. A prize! a prize!
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
</br>yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
</br>shorn. what comes the wool to?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
</br>I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
</br>of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
</br>this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
</br>hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
</br>on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
</br>the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
</br>ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
</br>one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
</br>horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
</br>pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
</br>nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
</br>may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
</br>raisins o' the sun.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>O that ever I was born!
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>I' the name of me--
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
</br>then, death, death!
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
</br>on thee, rather than have these off.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
</br>than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
</br>ones and millions.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
</br>great matter.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
</br>ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
</br>me.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>What, by a horseman, or a footman?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
</br>has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
</br>it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
</br>I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>O, good sir, tenderly, O!
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Alas, poor soul!
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
</br>shoulder-blade is out.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>How now! canst stand?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
</br>a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
</br>unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
</br>any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
</br>that kills my heart.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
</br>troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
</br>prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
</br>virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
</br>out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
</br>there; and yet it will no more but abide.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
</br>hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
</br>process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
</br>motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
</br>wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
</br>and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
</br>settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
</br>wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
</br>put me into this apparel.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
</br>but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
</br>false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
</br>him.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>How do you now?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
</br>walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
</br>softly towards my kinsman's.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Shall I bring thee on the way?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
</br>sheep-shearing.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Prosper you, sweet sir!
</br>Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
</br>I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
</br>make not this cheat bring out another and the
</br>shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
</br>put in the book of virtue!
</br>Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
</br>And merrily hent the stile-a:
</br>A merry heart goes all the day,
</br>Your sad tires in a mile-a.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>These your unusual weeds to each part of you
</br>Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
</br>Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
</br>Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
</br>And you the queen on't.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Sir, my gracious lord,
</br>To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
</br>O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
</br>The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
</br>With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
</br>Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
</br>In every mess have folly and the feeders
</br>Digest it with a custom, I should blush
</br>To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
</br>To show myself a glass.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>I bless the time
</br>When my good falcon made her flight across
</br>Thy father's ground.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Now Jove afford you cause!
</br>To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
</br>Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
</br>To think your father, by some accident,
</br>Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
</br>How would he look, to see his work so noble
</br>Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
</br>Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
</br>The sternness of his presence?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Apprehend
</br>Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
</br>Humbling their deities to love, have taken
</br>The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
</br>Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
</br>A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
</br>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
</br>As I seem now. Their transformations
</br>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
</br>Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
</br>Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
</br>Burn hotter than my faith.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>O, but, sir,
</br>Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
</br>Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
</br>One of these two must be necessities,
</br>Which then will speak, that you must
</br>change this purpose,
</br>Or I my life.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Thou dearest Perdita,
</br>With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
</br>The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
</br>Or not my father's. For I cannot be
</br>Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
</br>I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
</br>Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
</br>Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
</br>That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
</br>Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
</br>Of celebration of that nuptial which
</br>We two have sworn shall come.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>O lady Fortune,
</br>Stand you auspicious!
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>See, your guests approach:
</br>Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
</br>And let's be red with mirth.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
</br>This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
</br>Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
</br>Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
</br>At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
</br>On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
</br>With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
</br>She would to each one sip. You are retired,
</br>As if you were a feasted one and not
</br>The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
</br>These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
</br>A way to make us better friends, more known.
</br>Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
</br>That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
</br>And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
</br>As your good flock shall prosper.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Shepherdess,
</br>A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
</br>With flowers of winter.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Sir, the year growing ancient,
</br>Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
</br>Of trembling winter, the fairest
</br>flowers o' the season
</br>Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
</br>Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
</br>Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
</br>To get slips of them.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Wherefore, gentle maiden,
</br>Do you neglect them?
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>For I have heard it said
</br>There is an art which in their piedness shares
</br>With great creating nature.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Say there be;
</br>Yet nature is made better by no mean
</br>But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
</br>Which you say adds to nature, is an art
</br>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
</br>A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
</br>And make conceive a bark of baser kind
</br>By bud of nobler race: this is an art
</br>Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
</br>The art itself is nature.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>So it is.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
</br>And do not call them bastards.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>I'll not put
</br>The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
</br>No more than were I painted I would wish
</br>This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
</br>Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
</br>Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
</br>The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
</br>And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
</br>Of middle summer, and I think they are given
</br>To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
</br>And only live by gazing.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Out, alas!
</br>You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
</br>Would blow you through and through.
</br>Now, my fair'st friend,
</br>I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
</br>Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
</br>That wear upon your virgin branches yet
</br>Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
</br>For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
</br>From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
</br>That come before the swallow dares, and take
</br>The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
</br>But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
</br>Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
</br>That die unmarried, ere they can behold
</br>Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
</br>Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
</br>The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
</br>The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
</br>To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
</br>To strew him o'er and o'er!
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>What, like a corse?
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
</br>Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
</br>But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
</br>Methinks I play as I have seen them do
</br>In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
</br>Does change my disposition.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>What you do
</br>Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
</br>I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
</br>I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
</br>Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
</br>To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
</br>A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
</br>Nothing but that; move still, still so,
</br>And own no other function: each your doing,
</br>So singular in each particular,
</br>Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
</br>That all your acts are queens.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>O Doricles,
</br>Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
</br>And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
</br>Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
</br>With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
</br>You woo'd me the false way.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>I think you have
</br>As little skill to fear as I have purpose
</br>To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
</br>Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
</br>That never mean to part.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>I'll swear for 'em.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
</br>Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
</br>But smacks of something greater than herself,
</br>Too noble for this place.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>He tells her something
</br>That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
</br>The queen of curds and cream.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Come on, strike up!
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
</br>To mend her kissing with!
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>Now, in good time!
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
</br>Come, strike up!
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
</br>Which dances with your daughter?
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
</br>To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
</br>Upon his own report and I believe it;
</br>He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
</br>I think so too; for never gazed the moon
</br>Upon the water as he'll stand and read
</br>As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
</br>I think there is not half a kiss to choose
</br>Who loves another best.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>She dances featly.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>So she does any thing; though I report it,
</br>That should be silent: if young Doricles
</br>Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
</br>Which he not dreams of.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
</br>door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
</br>pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
</br>several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
</br>utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
</br>ears grew to his tunes.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>He could never come better; he shall come in. I
</br>love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
</br>matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
</br>indeed and sung lamentably.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
</br>milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
</br>has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
</br>bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
</br>burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
</br>her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
</br>as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
</br>the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
</br>no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
</br>'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>This is a brave fellow.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
</br>fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
</br>points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
</br>learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
</br>gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
</br>sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
</br>would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
</br>to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
</br>than you'ld think, sister.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Lawn as white as driven snow;
</br>Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
</br>Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
</br>Masks for faces and for noses;
</br>Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
</br>Perfume for a lady's chamber;
</br>Golden quoifs and stomachers,
</br>For my lads to give their dears:
</br>Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
</br>What maids lack from head to heel:
</br>Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
</br>Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
</br>no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
</br>will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>I was promised them against the feast; but they come
</br>not too late now.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
</br>paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Is there no manners left among maids? will they
</br>wear their plackets where they should bear their
</br>faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
</br>going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
</br>secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
</br>our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
</br>your tongues, and not a word more.
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
</br>and a pair of sweet gloves.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
</br>and lost all my money?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
</br>therefore it behoves men to be wary.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>What hast here? ballads?
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
</br>life, for then we are sure they are true.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
</br>wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
</br>burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
</br>toads carbonadoed.
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>Is it true, think you?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Very true, and but a month old.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>Bless me from marrying a usurer!
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
</br>Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
</br>present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>Pray you now, buy it.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
</br>ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
</br>the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
</br>forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
</br>ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
</br>thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
</br>fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
</br>loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>Is it true too, think you?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
</br>my pack will hold.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Lay it by too: another.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>Let's have some merry ones.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
</br>the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
</br>scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
</br>request, I can tell you.
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
</br>shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>We had the tune on't a month ago.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
</br>occupation; have at it with you.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Get you hence, for I must go
</br>Where it fits not you to know.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>Whither?
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>O, whither?
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>Whither?
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>It becomes thy oath full well,
</br>Thou to me thy secrets tell.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>Me too, let me go thither.
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>If to either, thou dost ill.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Neither.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>What, neither?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Neither.
</br>
</br>DORCAS:
</br>Thou hast sworn my love to be.
</br>
</br>MOPSA:
</br>Thou hast sworn it more to me:
</br>Then whither goest? say, whither?
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
</br>father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
</br>not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
</br>me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
</br>have the first choice. Follow me, girls.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>And you shall pay well for 'em.
</br>Will you buy any tape,
</br>Or lace for your cape,
</br>My dainty duck, my dear-a?
</br>Any silk, any thread,
</br>Any toys for your head,
</br>Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
</br>Come to the pedlar;
</br>Money's a medler.
</br>That doth utter all men's ware-a.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
</br>three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
</br>themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
</br>Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
</br>say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
</br>not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
</br>be not too rough for some that know little but
</br>bowling, it will please plentifully.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
</br>homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
</br>these four threes of herdsmen.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
</br>danced before the king; and not the worst of the
</br>three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Leave your prating: since these good men are
</br>pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Why, they stay at door, sir.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
</br>Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
</br>He's simple and tells much.
</br>How now, fair shepherd!
</br>Your heart is full of something that does take
</br>Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
</br>And handed love as you do, I was wont
</br>To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
</br>The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
</br>To her acceptance; you have let him go
</br>And nothing marted with him. If your lass
</br>Interpretation should abuse and call this
</br>Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
</br>For a reply, at least if you make a care
</br>Of happy holding her.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Old sir, I know
</br>She prizes not such trifles as these are:
</br>The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
</br>Up in my heart; which I have given already,
</br>But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
</br>Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
</br>Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
</br>As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
</br>Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
</br>snow that's bolted
</br>By the northern blasts twice o'er.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>What follows this?
</br>How prettily the young swain seems to wash
</br>The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
</br>But to your protestation; let me hear
</br>What you profess.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Do, and be witness to 't.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>And this my neighbour too?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>And he, and more
</br>Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
</br>That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
</br>Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
</br>That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
</br>More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
</br>Without her love; for her employ them all;
</br>Commend them and condemn them to her service
</br>Or to their own perdition.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Fairly offer'd.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>This shows a sound affection.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>But, my daughter,
</br>Say you the like to him?
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>I cannot speak
</br>So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
</br>By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
</br>The purity of his.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Take hands, a bargain!
</br>And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
</br>I give my daughter to him, and will make
</br>Her portion equal his.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>O, that must be
</br>I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
</br>I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
</br>Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
</br>Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Come, your hand;
</br>And, daughter, yours.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
</br>Have you a father?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>I have: but what of him?
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Knows he of this?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>He neither does nor shall.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Methinks a father
</br>Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
</br>That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
</br>Is not your father grown incapable
</br>Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
</br>With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
</br>Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
</br>Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
</br>But what he did being childish?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>No, good sir;
</br>He has his health and ampler strength indeed
</br>Than most have of his age.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>By my white beard,
</br>You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
</br>Something unfilial: reason my son
</br>Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
</br>The father, all whose joy is nothing else
</br>But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
</br>In such a business.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>I yield all this;
</br>But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
</br>Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
</br>My father of this business.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Let him know't.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>He shall not.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Prithee, let him.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>No, he must not.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
</br>At knowing of thy choice.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Come, come, he must not.
</br>Mark our contract.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Mark your divorce, young sir,
</br>Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
</br>To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
</br>That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
</br>I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
</br>But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
</br>Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
</br>The royal fool thou copest with,--
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>O, my heart!
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
</br>More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
</br>If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
</br>That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
</br>I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
</br>Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
</br>Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
</br>Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
</br>Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
</br>From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
</br>Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
</br>That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
</br>Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
</br>These rural latches to his entrance open,
</br>Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
</br>I will devise a death as cruel for thee
</br>As thou art tender to't.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Even here undone!
</br>I was not much afeard; for once or twice
</br>I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
</br>The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
</br>Hides not his visage from our cottage but
</br>Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
</br>I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
</br>Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
</br>Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
</br>But milk my ewes and weep.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Why, how now, father!
</br>Speak ere thou diest.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>I cannot speak, nor think
</br>Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
</br>You have undone a man of fourscore three,
</br>That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
</br>To die upon the bed my father died,
</br>To lie close by his honest bones: but now
</br>Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
</br>Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
</br>That knew'st this was the prince,
</br>and wouldst adventure
</br>To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
</br>If I might die within this hour, I have lived
</br>To die when I desire.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Why look you so upon me?
</br>I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
</br>But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
</br>More straining on for plucking back, not following
</br>My leash unwillingly.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Gracious my lord,
</br>You know your father's temper: at this time
</br>He will allow no speech, which I do guess
</br>You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
</br>Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
</br>Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
</br>Come not before him.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>I not purpose it.
</br>I think, Camillo?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Even he, my lord.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
</br>How often said, my dignity would last
</br>But till 'twere known!
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>It cannot fail but by
</br>The violation of my faith; and then
</br>Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
</br>And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
</br>From my succession wipe me, father; I
</br>Am heir to my affection.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Be advised.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
</br>Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
</br>If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
</br>Do bid it welcome.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>This is desperate, sir.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
</br>I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
</br>Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
</br>Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
</br>The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
</br>In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
</br>To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
</br>As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
</br>When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
</br>To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
</br>Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
</br>Tug for the time to come. This you may know
</br>And so deliver, I am put to sea
</br>With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
</br>And most opportune to our need I have
</br>A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
</br>For this design. What course I mean to hold
</br>Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
</br>Concern me the reporting.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>O my lord!
</br>I would your spirit were easier for advice,
</br>Or stronger for your need.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Hark, Perdita
</br>I'll hear you by and by.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>He's irremoveable,
</br>Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
</br>His going I could frame to serve my turn,
</br>Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
</br>Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
</br>And that unhappy king, my master, whom
</br>I so much thirst to see.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Now, good Camillo;
</br>I am so fraught with curious business that
</br>I leave out ceremony.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Sir, I think
</br>You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
</br>That I have borne your father?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Very nobly
</br>Have you deserved: it is my father's music
</br>To speak your deeds, not little of his care
</br>To have them recompensed as thought on.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Well, my lord,
</br>If you may please to think I love the king
</br>And through him what is nearest to him, which is
</br>Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
</br>If your more ponderous and settled project
</br>May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
</br>I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
</br>As shall become your highness; where you may
</br>Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
</br>There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
</br>As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
</br>And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
</br>Your discontenting father strive to qualify
</br>And bring him up to liking.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>How, Camillo,
</br>May this, almost a miracle, be done?
</br>That I may call thee something more than man
</br>And after that trust to thee.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Have you thought on
</br>A place whereto you'll go?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Not any yet:
</br>But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
</br>To what we wildly do, so we profess
</br>Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
</br>Of every wind that blows.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Then list to me:
</br>This follows, if you will not change your purpose
</br>But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
</br>And there present yourself and your fair princess,
</br>For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
</br>She shall be habited as it becomes
</br>The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
</br>Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
</br>His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
</br>As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
</br>Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
</br>'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
</br>He chides to hell and bids the other grow
</br>Faster than thought or time.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Worthy Camillo,
</br>What colour for my visitation shall I
</br>Hold up before him?
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Sent by the king your father
</br>To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
</br>The manner of your bearing towards him, with
</br>What you as from your father shall deliver,
</br>Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
</br>The which shall point you forth at every sitting
</br>What you must say; that he shall not perceive
</br>But that you have your father's bosom there
</br>And speak his very heart.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>I am bound to you:
</br>There is some sap in this.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>A cause more promising
</br>Than a wild dedication of yourselves
</br>To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
</br>To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
</br>But as you shake off one to take another;
</br>Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
</br>Do their best office, if they can but stay you
</br>Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
</br>Prosperity's the very bond of love,
</br>Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
</br>Affliction alters.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>One of these is true:
</br>I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
</br>But not take in the mind.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Yea, say you so?
</br>There shall not at your father's house these
</br>seven years
</br>Be born another such.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>My good Camillo,
</br>She is as forward of her breeding as
</br>She is i' the rear our birth.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>I cannot say 'tis pity
</br>She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
</br>To most that teach.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Your pardon, sir; for this
</br>I'll blush you thanks.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>My prettiest Perdita!
</br>But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
</br>Preserver of my father, now of me,
</br>The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
</br>We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
</br>Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>My lord,
</br>Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
</br>Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
</br>To have you royally appointed as if
</br>The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
</br>That you may know you shall not want, one word.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
</br>sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
</br>all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
</br>ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
</br>knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
</br>to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
</br>should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
</br>hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
</br>by which means I saw whose purse was best in
</br>picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
</br>remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
</br>be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
</br>wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
</br>till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
</br>rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
</br>stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
</br>was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
</br>purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
</br>chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
</br>and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
</br>time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
</br>festival purses; and had not the old man come in
</br>with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
</br>son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
</br>left a purse alive in the whole army.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
</br>So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Shall satisfy your father.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>Happy be you!
</br>All that you speak shows fair.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Who have we here?
</br>We'll make an instrument of this, omit
</br>Nothing may give us aid.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
</br>not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I am a poor fellow, sir.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
</br>thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
</br>make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
</br>--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
</br>change garments with this gentleman: though the
</br>pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
</br>there's some boot.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I am a poor fellow, sir.
</br>I know ye well enough.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
</br>flayed already.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Are you in earnest, sir?
</br>I smell the trick on't.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Dispatch, I prithee.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
</br>conscience take it.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Unbuckle, unbuckle.
</br>Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
</br>Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
</br>Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
</br>And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
</br>Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
</br>The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
</br>For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
</br>Get undescried.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>I see the play so lies
</br>That I must bear a part.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>No remedy.
</br>Have you done there?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Should I now meet my father,
</br>He would not call me son.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>Nay, you shall have no hat.
</br>Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Adieu, sir.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
</br>Pray you, a word.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Fortune speed us!
</br>Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>The swifter speed the better.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
</br>open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
</br>necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
</br>also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
</br>this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
</br>What an exchange had this been without boot! What
</br>a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
</br>this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
</br>extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
</br>iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
</br>clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
</br>honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
</br>do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
</br>and therein am I constant to my profession.
</br>Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
</br>every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
</br>hanging, yields a careful man work.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>See, see; what a man you are now!
</br>There is no other way but to tell the king
</br>she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Nay, but hear me.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Nay, but hear me.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Go to, then.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
</br>and blood has not offended the king; and so your
</br>flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
</br>those things you found about her, those secret
</br>things, all but what she has with her: this being
</br>done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
</br>son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
</br>neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
</br>me the king's brother-in-law.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
</br>could have been to him and then your blood had been
</br>the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
</br>fardel will make him scratch his beard.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Pray heartily he be at palace.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>To the palace, an it like your worship.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
</br>of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
</br>names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
</br>thing that is fitting to be known, discover.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>We are but plain fellows, sir.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
</br>lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
</br>often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
</br>it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
</br>they do not give us the lie.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
</br>had not taken yourself with the manner.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
</br>thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
</br>hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
</br>receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
</br>not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
</br>for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
</br>business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
</br>cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
</br>back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
</br>open thy affair.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>My business, sir, is to the king.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>What advocate hast thou to him?
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>I know not, an't like you.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
</br>have none.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>How blessed are we that are not simple men!
</br>Yet nature might have made me as these are,
</br>Therefore I will not disdain.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>This cannot be but a great courtier.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>His garments are rich, but he wears
</br>them not handsomely.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
</br>a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
</br>on's teeth.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
</br>Wherefore that box?
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
</br>which none must know but the king; and which he
</br>shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
</br>speech of him.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Why, sir?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
</br>new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
</br>if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
</br>know the king is full of grief.
</br>
</br>Shepard:
</br>So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
</br>married a shepherd's daughter.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
</br>the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
</br>feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Think you so, sir?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
</br>and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
</br>him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
</br>under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
</br>yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
</br>ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
</br>grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
</br>is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a
</br>sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
</br>like you, sir?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
</br>'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
</br>wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
</br>and a dram dead; then recovered again with
</br>aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
</br>he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
</br>proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
</br>sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
</br>is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
</br>talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
</br>are to be smiled at, their offences being so
</br>capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
</br>men, what you have to the king: being something
</br>gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
</br>aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
</br>whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
</br>besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
</br>shall do it.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
</br>give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
</br>bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
</br>the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
</br>and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
</br>us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
</br>more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>After I have done what I promised?
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Ay, sir.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
</br>one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
</br>he'll be made an example.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
</br>our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
</br>daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
</br>will give you as much as this old man does when the
</br>business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
</br>pawn till it be brought you.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
</br>go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
</br>hedge and follow you.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
</br>not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
</br>courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
</br>to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
</br>that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
</br>these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
</br>think it fit to shore them again and that the
</br>complaint they have to the king concerns him
</br>nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
</br>officious; for I am proof against that title and
</br>what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
</br>them: there may be matter in it.
</br>
</br>CLEOMENES:
</br>Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
</br>A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
</br>Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
</br>More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
</br>Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
</br>With them forgive yourself.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Whilst I remember
</br>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
</br>My blemishes in them, and so still think of
</br>The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
</br>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
</br>Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
</br>Bred his hopes out of.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>True, too true, my lord:
</br>If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
</br>Or from the all that are took something good,
</br>To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
</br>Would be unparallel'd.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>I think so. Kill'd!
</br>She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
</br>Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
</br>Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
</br>Say so but seldom.
</br>
</br>CLEOMENES:
</br>Not at all, good lady:
</br>You might have spoken a thousand things that would
</br>Have done the time more benefit and graced
</br>Your kindness better.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>You are one of those
</br>Would have him wed again.
</br>
</br>DION:
</br>If you would not so,
</br>You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
</br>Of his most sovereign name; consider little
</br>What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
</br>May drop upon his kingdom and devour
</br>Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
</br>Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
</br>What holier than, for royalty's repair,
</br>For present comfort and for future good,
</br>To bless the bed of majesty again
</br>With a sweet fellow to't?
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>There is none worthy,
</br>Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
</br>Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
</br>For has not the divine Apollo said,
</br>Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
</br>That King Leontes shall not have an heir
</br>Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
</br>Is all as monstrous to our human reason
</br>As my Antigonus to break his grave
</br>And come again to me; who, on my life,
</br>Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
</br>My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
</br>Oppose against their wills.
</br>Care not for issue;
</br>The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
</br>Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
</br>Was like to be the best.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Good Paulina,
</br>Who hast the memory of Hermione,
</br>I know, in honour, O, that ever I
</br>Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
</br>I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
</br>Have taken treasure from her lips--
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>And left them
</br>More rich for what they yielded.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Thou speak'st truth.
</br>No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
</br>And better used, would make her sainted spirit
</br>Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
</br>Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
</br>And begin, 'Why to me?'
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Had she such power,
</br>She had just cause.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>She had; and would incense me
</br>To murder her I married.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I should so.
</br>Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
</br>Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
</br>You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
</br>Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
</br>Should be 'Remember mine.'
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Stars, stars,
</br>And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
</br>I'll have no wife, Paulina.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Will you swear
</br>Never to marry but by my free leave?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
</br>
</br>CLEOMENES:
</br>You tempt him over-much.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Unless another,
</br>As like Hermione as is her picture,
</br>Affront his eye.
</br>
</br>CLEOMENES:
</br>Good madam,--
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I have done.
</br>Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
</br>No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
</br>To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
</br>As was your former; but she shall be such
</br>As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
</br>it should take joy
</br>To see her in your arms.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>My true Paulina,
</br>We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>That
</br>Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
</br>Never till then.
</br>
</br>Gentleman:
</br>One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
</br>Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
</br>The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
</br>To your high presence.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>What with him? he comes not
</br>Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
</br>So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
</br>'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
</br>By need and accident. What train?
</br>
</br>Gentleman:
</br>But few,
</br>And those but mean.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>His princess, say you, with him?
</br>
</br>Gentleman:
</br>Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
</br>That e'er the sun shone bright on.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>O Hermione,
</br>As every present time doth boast itself
</br>Above a better gone, so must thy grave
</br>Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
</br>Have said and writ so, but your writing now
</br>Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
</br>Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
</br>Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
</br>To say you have seen a better.
</br>
</br>Gentleman:
</br>Pardon, madam:
</br>The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
</br>The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
</br>Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
</br>Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
</br>Of all professors else, make proselytes
</br>Of who she but bid follow.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>How! not women?
</br>
</br>Gentleman:
</br>Women will love her, that she is a woman
</br>More worth than any man; men, that she is
</br>The rarest of all women.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Go, Cleomenes;
</br>Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
</br>Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
</br>He thus should steal upon us.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Had our prince,
</br>Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
</br>Well with this lord: there was not full a month
</br>Between their births.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
</br>He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
</br>When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
</br>Will bring me to consider that which may
</br>Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
</br>Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
</br>For she did print your royal father off,
</br>Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
</br>Your father's image is so hit in you,
</br>His very air, that I should call you brother,
</br>As I did him, and speak of something wildly
</br>By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
</br>And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
</br>I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
</br>Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
</br>You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
</br>All mine own folly--the society,
</br>Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
</br>Though bearing misery, I desire my life
</br>Once more to look on him.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>By his command
</br>Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
</br>Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
</br>Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
</br>Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
</br>His wish'd ability, he had himself
</br>The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
</br>Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
</br>He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
</br>And those that bear them living.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>O my brother,
</br>Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
</br>Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
</br>So rarely kind, are as interpreters
</br>Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
</br>As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
</br>Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
</br>At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
</br>To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
</br>The adventure of her person?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Good my lord,
</br>She came from Libya.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Where the warlike Smalus,
</br>That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
</br>His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
</br>A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
</br>To execute the charge my father gave me
</br>For visiting your highness: my best train
</br>I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
</br>Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
</br>Not only my success in Libya, sir,
</br>But my arrival and my wife's in safety
</br>Here where we are.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>The blessed gods
</br>Purge all infection from our air whilst you
</br>Do climate here! You have a holy father,
</br>A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
</br>So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
</br>For which the heavens, taking angry note,
</br>Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
</br>As he from heaven merits it, with you
</br>Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
</br>Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
</br>Such goodly things as you!
</br>
</br>Lord:
</br>Most noble sir,
</br>That which I shall report will bear no credit,
</br>Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
</br>Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
</br>Desires you to attach his son, who has--
</br>His dignity and duty both cast off--
</br>Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
</br>A shepherd's daughter.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Where's Bohemia? speak.
</br>
</br>Lord:
</br>Here in your city; I now came from him:
</br>I speak amazedly; and it becomes
</br>My marvel and my message. To your court
</br>Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
</br>Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
</br>The father of this seeming lady and
</br>Her brother, having both their country quitted
</br>With this young prince.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Camillo has betray'd me;
</br>Whose honour and whose honesty till now
</br>Endured all weathers.
</br>
</br>Lord:
</br>Lay't so to his charge:
</br>He's with the king your father.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Who? Camillo?
</br>
</br>Lord:
</br>Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
</br>Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
</br>Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
</br>Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
</br>Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
</br>With divers deaths in death.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>O my poor father!
</br>The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
</br>Our contract celebrated.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>You are married?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
</br>The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
</br>The odds for high and low's alike.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>My lord,
</br>Is this the daughter of a king?
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>She is,
</br>When once she is my wife.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
</br>Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
</br>Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
</br>Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
</br>Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
</br>That you might well enjoy her.
</br>
</br>FLORIZEL:
</br>Dear, look up:
</br>Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
</br>Should chase us with my father, power no jot
</br>Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
</br>Remember since you owed no more to time
</br>Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
</br>Step forth mine advocate; at your request
</br>My father will grant precious things as trifles.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
</br>Which he counts but a trifle.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Sir, my liege,
</br>Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
</br>'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
</br>Than what you look on now.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>I thought of her,
</br>Even in these looks I made.
</br>But your petition
</br>Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
</br>Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
</br>I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
</br>I now go toward him; therefore follow me
</br>And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
</br>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
</br>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
</br>commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
</br>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I would most gladly know the issue of it.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
</br>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
</br>very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
</br>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
</br>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
</br>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
</br>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
</br>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
</br>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
</br>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
</br>extremity of the one, it must needs be.
</br>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
</br>The news, Rogero?
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
</br>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
</br>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
</br>cannot be able to express it.
</br>Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
</br>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
</br>which is called true is so like an old tale, that
</br>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
</br>found his heir?
</br>
</br>Third Gentleman:
</br>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
</br>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
</br>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
</br>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
</br>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
</br>know to be his character, the majesty of the
</br>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
</br>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
</br>and many other evidences proclaim her with all
</br>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
</br>the meeting of the two kings?
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>No.
</br>
</br>Third Gentleman:
</br>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
</br>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
</br>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
</br>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
</br>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
</br>holding up of hands, with countenances of such
</br>distraction that they were to be known by garment,
</br>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
</br>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
</br>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
</br>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
</br>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
</br>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
</br>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
</br>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
</br>another encounter, which lames report to follow it
</br>and undoes description to do it.
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
</br>hence the child?
</br>
</br>Third Gentleman:
</br>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
</br>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
</br>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
</br>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
</br>innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
</br>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>What became of his bark and his followers?
</br>
</br>Third Gentleman:
</br>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
</br>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
</br>instruments which aided to expose the child were
</br>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
</br>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
</br>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
</br>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
</br>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
</br>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
</br>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
</br>of losing.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
</br>kings and princes; for by such was it acted.
</br>
</br>Third Gentleman:
</br>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
</br>angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
</br>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
</br>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
</br>confessed and lamented by the king, how
</br>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
</br>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
</br>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
</br>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
</br>colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
</br>could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>Are they returned to the court?
</br>
</br>Third Gentleman:
</br>No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
</br>which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
</br>years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
</br>Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
</br>eternity and could put breath into his work, would
</br>beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
</br>ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
</br>they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
</br>answer: thither with all greediness of affection
</br>are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
</br>for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
</br>since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
</br>house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
</br>the rejoicing?
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
</br>every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
</br>our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
</br>Let's along.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
</br>would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
</br>man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
</br>them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
</br>at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
</br>so he then took her to be, who began to be much
</br>sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
</br>weather continuing, this mystery remained
</br>undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
</br>been the finder out of this secret, it would not
</br>have relished among my other discredits.
</br>Here come those I have done good to against my will,
</br>and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
</br>daughters will be all gentlemen born.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
</br>this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
</br>See you these clothes? say you see them not and
</br>think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
</br>these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
</br>lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>And so have I, boy.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
</br>father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
</br>called me brother; and then the two kings called my
</br>father brother; and then the prince my brother and
</br>the princess my sister called my father father; and
</br>so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
</br>tears that ever we shed.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>We may live, son, to shed many more.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
</br>preposterous estate as we are.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
</br>faults I have committed to your worship and to give
</br>me your good report to the prince my master.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
</br>gentlemen.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Thou wilt amend thy life?
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>Ay, an it like your good worship.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
</br>art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>You may say it, but not swear it.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
</br>franklins say it, I'll swear it.
</br>
</br>Shepherd:
</br>How if it be false, son?
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
</br>it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
</br>the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
</br>that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
</br>tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
</br>drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
</br>be a tall fellow of thy hands.
</br>
</br>AUTOLYCUS:
</br>I will prove so, sir, to my power.
</br>
</br>Clown:
</br>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
</br>wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
</br>being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
</br>and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
</br>queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
</br>good masters.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
</br>That I have had of thee!
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>What, sovereign sir,
</br>I did not well I meant well. All my services
</br>You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
</br>With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
</br>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
</br>It is a surplus of your grace, which never
</br>My life may last to answer.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>O Paulina,
</br>We honour you with trouble: but we came
</br>To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
</br>Have we pass'd through, not without much content
</br>In many singularities; but we saw not
</br>That which my daughter came to look upon,
</br>The statue of her mother.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>As she lived peerless,
</br>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
</br>Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
</br>Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
</br>Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
</br>To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
</br>Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
</br>I like your silence, it the more shows off
</br>Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
</br>Comes it not something near?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Her natural posture!
</br>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
</br>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
</br>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
</br>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
</br>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
</br>So aged as this seems.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>O, not by much.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>So much the more our carver's excellence;
</br>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
</br>As she lived now.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>As now she might have done,
</br>So much to my good comfort, as it is
</br>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
</br>Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
</br>As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
</br>I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
</br>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
</br>There's magic in thy majesty, which has
</br>My evils conjured to remembrance and
</br>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
</br>Standing like stone with thee.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>And give me leave,
</br>And do not say 'tis superstition, that
</br>I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
</br>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
</br>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>O, patience!
</br>The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
</br>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
</br>So many summers dry; scarce any joy
</br>Did ever so long live; no sorrow
</br>But kill'd itself much sooner.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Dear my brother,
</br>Let him that was the cause of this have power
</br>To take off so much grief from you as he
</br>Will piece up in himself.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Indeed, my lord,
</br>If I had thought the sight of my poor image
</br>Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
</br>I'ld not have show'd it.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Do not draw the curtain.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
</br>May think anon it moves.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Let be, let be.
</br>Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
</br>What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
</br>Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
</br>Did verily bear blood?
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Masterly done:
</br>The very life seems warm upon her lip.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
</br>As we are mock'd with art.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I'll draw the curtain:
</br>My lord's almost so far transported that
</br>He'll think anon it lives.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>O sweet Paulina,
</br>Make me to think so twenty years together!
</br>No settled senses of the world can match
</br>The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
</br>I could afflict you farther.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Do, Paulina;
</br>For this affliction has a taste as sweet
</br>As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
</br>There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
</br>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
</br>For I will kiss her.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Good my lord, forbear:
</br>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
</br>You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
</br>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>No, not these twenty years.
</br>
</br>PERDITA:
</br>So long could I
</br>Stand by, a looker on.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Either forbear,
</br>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
</br>For more amazement. If you can behold it,
</br>I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
</br>And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
</br>Which I protest against--I am assisted
</br>By wicked powers.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>What you can make her do,
</br>I am content to look on: what to speak,
</br>I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
</br>To make her speak as move.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>It is required
</br>You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
</br>On: those that think it is unlawful business
</br>I am about, let them depart.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>Proceed:
</br>No foot shall stir.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>Music, awake her; strike!
</br>'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
</br>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
</br>I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
</br>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
</br>Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
</br>Start not; her actions shall be holy as
</br>You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
</br>Until you see her die again; for then
</br>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
</br>When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
</br>Is she become the suitor?
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>O, she's warm!
</br>If this be magic, let it be an art
</br>Lawful as eating.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>She embraces him.
</br>
</br>CAMILLO:
</br>She hangs about his neck:
</br>If she pertain to life let her speak too.
</br>
</br>POLIXENES:
</br>Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
</br>Or how stolen from the dead.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>That she is living,
</br>Were it but told you, should be hooted at
</br>Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
</br>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
</br>Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
</br>And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
</br>Our Perdita is found.
</br>
</br>HERMIONE:
</br>You gods, look down
</br>And from your sacred vials pour your graces
</br>Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
</br>Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
</br>Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
</br>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
</br>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
</br>Myself to see the issue.
</br>
</br>PAULINA:
</br>There's time enough for that;
</br>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
</br>Your joys with like relation. Go together,
</br>You precious winners all; your exultation
</br>Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
</br>Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
</br>My mate, that's never to be found again,
</br>Lament till I am lost.
</br>
</br>LEONTES:
</br>O, peace, Paulina!
</br>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
</br>As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
</br>And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
</br>But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
</br>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
</br>A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
</br>For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
</br>An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
</br>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
</br>Is richly noted and here justified
</br>By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
</br>What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
</br>That e'er I put between your holy looks
</br>My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
</br>And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
</br>Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
</br>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
</br>Each one demand an answer to his part
</br>Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
</br>We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Escalus.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>My lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Of government the properties to unfold,
</br>Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
</br>Since I am put to know that your own science
</br>Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
</br>My strength can give you: then no more remains,
</br>But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,
</br>And let them work. The nature of our people,
</br>Our city's institutions, and the terms
</br>For common justice, you're as pregnant in
</br>As art and practise hath enriched any
</br>That we remember. There is our commission,
</br>From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
</br>I say, bid come before us Angelo.
</br>What figure of us think you he will bear?
</br>For you must know, we have with special soul
</br>Elected him our absence to supply,
</br>Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
</br>And given his deputation all the organs
</br>Of our own power: what think you of it?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>If any in Vienna be of worth
</br>To undergo such ample grace and honour,
</br>It is Lord Angelo.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Look where he comes.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Always obedient to your grace's will,
</br>I come to know your pleasure.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Angelo,
</br>There is a kind of character in thy life,
</br>That to the observer doth thy history
</br>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
</br>Are not thine own so proper as to waste
</br>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
</br>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
</br>Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
</br>Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
</br>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
</br>But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
</br>The smallest scruple of her excellence
</br>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
</br>Herself the glory of a creditor,
</br>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
</br>To one that can my part in him advertise;
</br>Hold therefore, Angelo:--
</br>In our remove be thou at full ourself;
</br>Mortality and mercy in Vienna
</br>Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
</br>Though first in question, is thy secondary.
</br>Take thy commission.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Now, good my lord,
</br>Let there be some more test made of my metal,
</br>Before so noble and so great a figure
</br>Be stamp'd upon it.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>No more evasion:
</br>We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
</br>Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
</br>Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
</br>That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
</br>Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
</br>As time and our concernings shall importune,
</br>How it goes with us, and do look to know
</br>What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
</br>To the hopeful execution do I leave you
</br>Of your commissions.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Yet give leave, my lord,
</br>That we may bring you something on the way.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>My haste may not admit it;
</br>Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
</br>With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
</br>So to enforce or qualify the laws
</br>As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
</br>I'll privily away. I love the people,
</br>But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
</br>Through it do well, I do not relish well
</br>Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
</br>Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
</br>That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>The heavens give safety to your purposes!
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
</br>
</br>DUKE:
</br>I thank you. Fare you well.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
</br>To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
</br>To look into the bottom of my place:
</br>A power I have, but of what strength and nature
</br>I am not yet instructed.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
</br>And we may soon our satisfaction have
</br>Touching that point.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I'll wait upon your honour.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>If the duke with the other dukes come not to
</br>composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
</br>the dukes fall upon the king.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
</br>Hungary's!
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>Amen.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
</br>went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
</br>one out of the table.
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>'Thou shalt not steal'?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Ay, that he razed.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
</br>all the rest from their functions: they put forth
</br>to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
</br>the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
</br>well that prays for peace.
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>I never heard any soldier dislike it.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
</br>grace was said.
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>No? a dozen times at least.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>What, in metre?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>In any proportion or in any language.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>I think, or in any religion.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
</br>controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
</br>wicked villain, despite of all grace.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I grant; as there may between the lists and the
</br>velvet. Thou art the list.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
</br>a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
</br>be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
</br>art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
</br>feelingly now?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
</br>feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
</br>confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
</br>live, forget to drink after thee.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
</br>have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>To what, I pray?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Judge.
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>To three thousand dolours a year.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>Ay, and more.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>A French crown more.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
</br>art full of error; I am sound.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
</br>things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
</br>impiety has made a feast of thee.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
</br>to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>Who's that, I pray thee?
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
</br>him carried away; and, which is more, within these
</br>three days his head to be chopped off.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
</br>Art thou sure of this?
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
</br>Julietta with child.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
</br>hours since, and he was ever precise in
</br>promise-keeping.
</br>
</br>Second Gentleman:
</br>Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
</br>speech we had to such a purpose.
</br>
</br>First Gentleman:
</br>But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
</br>with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
</br>custom-shrunk.
</br>How now! what's the news with you?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Yonder man is carried to prison.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>Well; what has he done?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>A woman.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>But what's his offence?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>What, is there a maid with child by him?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
</br>not heard of the proclamation, have you?
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>What proclamation, man?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>And what shall become of those in the city?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
</br>but that a wise burgher put in for them.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
</br>pulled down?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>To the ground, mistress.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
</br>What shall become of me?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
</br>clients: though you change your place, you need not
</br>change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
</br>Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
</br>have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
</br>will be considered.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
</br>prison; and there's Madam Juliet.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
</br>Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I do it not in evil disposition,
</br>But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Thus can the demigod Authority
</br>Make us pay down for our offence by weight
</br>The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
</br>On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
</br>As surfeit is the father of much fast,
</br>So every scope by the immoderate use
</br>Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
</br>Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
</br>A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
</br>send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
</br>the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
</br>as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
</br>offence, Claudio?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>What but to speak of would offend again.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>What, is't murder?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>No.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Lechery?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Call it so.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Away, sir! you must go.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
</br>Is lechery so look'd after?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
</br>I got possession of Julietta's bed:
</br>You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
</br>Save that we do the denunciation lack
</br>Of outward order: this we came not to,
</br>Only for propagation of a dower
</br>Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
</br>From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
</br>Till time had made them for us. But it chances
</br>The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
</br>With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>With child, perhaps?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Unhappily, even so.
</br>And the new deputy now for the duke--
</br>Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
</br>Or whether that the body public be
</br>A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
</br>Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
</br>He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
</br>Whether the tyranny be in his place,
</br>Or in his emmence that fills it up,
</br>I stagger in:--but this new governor
</br>Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
</br>Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
</br>So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
</br>And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
</br>Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
</br>Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
</br>thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
</br>may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
</br>him.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>I have done so, but he's not to be found.
</br>I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
</br>This day my sister should the cloister enter
</br>And there receive her approbation:
</br>Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
</br>Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
</br>To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
</br>I have great hope in that; for in her youth
</br>There is a prone and speechless dialect,
</br>Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
</br>When she will play with reason and discourse,
</br>And well she can persuade.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
</br>like, which else would stand under grievous
</br>imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
</br>would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
</br>game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>I thank you, good friend Lucio.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Within two hours.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Come, officer, away!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>No, holy father; throw away that thought;
</br>Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
</br>Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
</br>To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
</br>More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
</br>Of burning youth.
</br>
</br>FRIAR THOMAS:
</br>May your grace speak of it?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>My holy sir, none better knows than you
</br>How I have ever loved the life removed
</br>And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
</br>Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
</br>I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
</br>A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
</br>My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
</br>And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
</br>For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
</br>And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
</br>You will demand of me why I do this?
</br>
</br>FRIAR THOMAS:
</br>Gladly, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
</br>The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
</br>Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
</br>Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
</br>That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
</br>Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
</br>Only to stick it in their children's sight
</br>For terror, not to use, in time the rod
</br>Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
</br>Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
</br>And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
</br>The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
</br>Goes all decorum.
</br>
</br>FRIAR THOMAS:
</br>It rested in your grace
</br>To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
</br>And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
</br>Than in Lord Angelo.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I do fear, too dreadful:
</br>Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
</br>'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
</br>For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
</br>When evil deeds have their permissive pass
</br>And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
</br>I have on Angelo imposed the office;
</br>Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
</br>And yet my nature never in the fight
</br>To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
</br>I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
</br>Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
</br>Supply me with the habit and instruct me
</br>How I may formally in person bear me
</br>Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
</br>At our more leisure shall I render you;
</br>Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
</br>Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
</br>That his blood flows, or that his appetite
</br>Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
</br>If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>And have you nuns no farther privileges?
</br>
</br>FRANCISCA:
</br>Are not these large enough?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
</br>But rather wishing a more strict restraint
</br>Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Who's that which calls?
</br>
</br>FRANCISCA:
</br>It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
</br>Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
</br>You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
</br>When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
</br>But in the presence of the prioress:
</br>Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
</br>Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
</br>He calls again; I pray you, answer him.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
</br>Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
</br>As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
</br>A novice of this place and the fair sister
</br>To her unhappy brother Claudio?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
</br>The rather for I now must make you know
</br>I am that Isabella and his sister.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
</br>Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Woe me! for what?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>For that which, if myself might be his judge,
</br>He should receive his punishment in thanks:
</br>He hath got his friend with child.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Sir, make me not your story.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>It is true.
</br>I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
</br>With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
</br>Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
</br>I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
</br>By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
</br>And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
</br>As with a saint.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
</br>Your brother and his lover have embraced:
</br>As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
</br>That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
</br>To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
</br>Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Is she your cousin?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
</br>By vain though apt affection.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>She it is.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, let him marry her.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>This is the point.
</br>The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
</br>Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
</br>In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
</br>By those that know the very nerves of state,
</br>His givings-out were of an infinite distance
</br>From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
</br>And with full line of his authority,
</br>Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
</br>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
</br>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
</br>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
</br>With profits of the mind, study and fast.
</br>He--to give fear to use and liberty,
</br>Which have for long run by the hideous law,
</br>As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
</br>Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
</br>Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
</br>And follows close the rigour of the statute,
</br>To make him an example. All hope is gone,
</br>Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
</br>To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
</br>'Twixt you and your poor brother.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Doth he so seek his life?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Has censured him
</br>Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
</br>A warrant for his execution.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Alas! what poor ability's in me
</br>To do him good?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Assay the power you have.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>My power? Alas, I doubt--
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Our doubts are traitors
</br>And make us lose the good we oft might win
</br>By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
</br>And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
</br>Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
</br>All their petitions are as freely theirs
</br>As they themselves would owe them.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I'll see what I can do.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>But speedily.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I will about it straight;
</br>No longer staying but to give the mother
</br>Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
</br>Commend me to my brother: soon at night
</br>I'll send him certain word of my success.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I take my leave of you.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Good sir, adieu.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
</br>Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
</br>And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
</br>Their perch and not their terror.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Ay, but yet
</br>Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
</br>Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
</br>Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
</br>Let but your honour know,
</br>Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
</br>That, in the working of your own affections,
</br>Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
</br>Or that the resolute acting of your blood
</br>Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
</br>Whether you had not sometime in your life
</br>Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
</br>And pull'd the law upon you.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
</br>Another thing to fall. I not deny,
</br>The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
</br>May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
</br>Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
</br>That justice seizes: what know the laws
</br>That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
</br>The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
</br>Because we see it; but what we do not see
</br>We tread upon, and never think of it.
</br>You may not so extenuate his offence
</br>For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
</br>When I, that censure him, do so offend,
</br>Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
</br>And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Be it as your wisdom will.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Where is the provost?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Here, if it like your honour.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>See that Claudio
</br>Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
</br>Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
</br>For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
</br>a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
</br>common houses, I know no law: bring them away.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
</br>constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
</br>justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
</br>honour two notorious benefactors.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
</br>they not malefactors?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
</br>are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
</br>of; and void of all profanation in the world that
</br>good Christians ought to have.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
</br>name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>What are you, sir?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
</br>serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
</br>say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
</br>professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>How know you that?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>How? thy wife?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Dost thou detest her therefore?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
</br>she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
</br>it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>How dost thou know that, constable?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
</br>cardinally given, might have been accused in
</br>fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>By the woman's means?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
</br>spit in his face, so she defied him.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
</br>man; prove it.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Do you hear how he misplaces?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
</br>saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
</br>sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
</br>distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
</br>dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
</br>such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
</br>good dishes,--
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
</br>the right: but to the point. As I say, this
</br>Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
</br>being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
</br>prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
</br>Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
</br>rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
</br>honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
</br>not give you three-pence again.
</br>
</br>FROTH:
</br>No, indeed.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
</br>cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--
</br>
</br>FROTH:
</br>Ay, so I did indeed.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
</br>remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
</br>cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
</br>good diet, as I told you,--
</br>
</br>FROTH:
</br>All this is true.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Why, very well, then,--
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
</br>was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
</br>complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>No, sir, nor I mean it not.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
</br>leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
</br>here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
</br>father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
</br>Master Froth?
</br>
</br>FROTH:
</br>All-hallond eve.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
</br>sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
</br>the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
</br>to sit, have you not?
</br>
</br>FROTH:
</br>I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>This will last out a night in Russia,
</br>When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
</br>And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
</br>Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
</br>Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>I beseech your honour, ask me.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
</br>Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
</br>good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Ay, sir, very well.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Well, I do so.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Why, no.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
</br>thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
</br>worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
</br>constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
</br>your honour.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>First, an it like you, the house is a respected
</br>house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
</br>mistress is a respected woman.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
</br>person than any of us all.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
</br>time has yet to come that she was ever respected
</br>with man, woman, or child.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
</br>this true?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
</br>Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
</br>to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
</br>with me, let not your worship think me the poor
</br>duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
</br>I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
</br>action of slander too.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
</br>your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
</br>that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
</br>continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
</br>are.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
</br>wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
</br>to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Where were you born, friend?
</br>
</br>FROTH:
</br>Here in Vienna, sir.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
</br>
</br>FROTH:
</br>Yes, an't please you, sir.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>So. What trade are you of, sir?
</br>
</br>POMPHEY:
</br>Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Your mistress' name?
</br>
</br>POMPHEY:
</br>Mistress Overdone.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Hath she had any more than one husband?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
</br>Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
</br>tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
</br>will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
</br>more of you.
</br>
</br>FROTH:
</br>I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
</br>come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
</br>in.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
</br>Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
</br>name, Master tapster?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Pompey.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>What else?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Bum, sir.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
</br>so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
</br>Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
</br>howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
</br>not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
</br>do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>If the law would allow it, sir.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
</br>not be allowed in Vienna.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
</br>youth of the city?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>No, Pompey.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
</br>If your worship will take order for the drabs and
</br>the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
</br>it is but heading and hanging.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>If you head and hang all that offend that way but
</br>for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
</br>commission for more heads: if this law hold in
</br>Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
</br>after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
</br>come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
</br>prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
</br>you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
</br>no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
</br>I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
</br>Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
</br>have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>I thank your worship for your good counsel:
</br>but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
</br>better determine.
</br>Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
</br>The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
</br>constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Seven year and a half, sir.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
</br>continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>And a half, sir.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
</br>wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
</br>in your ward sufficient to serve it?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
</br>are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
</br>do it for some piece of money, and go through with
</br>all.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
</br>the most sufficient of your parish.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>To your worship's house, sir?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>To my house. Fare you well.
</br>What's o'clock, think you?
</br>
</br>Justice:
</br>Eleven, sir.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I pray you home to dinner with me.
</br>
</br>Justice:
</br>I humbly thank you.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
</br>But there's no remedy.
</br>
</br>Justice:
</br>Lord Angelo is severe.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>It is but needful:
</br>Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
</br>Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
</br>But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
</br>Come, sir.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
</br>I'll tell him of you.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Pray you, do.
</br>I'll know
</br>His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
</br>He hath but as offended in a dream!
</br>All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
</br>To die for't!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Now, what's the matter. Provost?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
</br>Why dost thou ask again?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Lest I might be too rash:
</br>Under your good correction, I have seen,
</br>When, after execution, judgment hath
</br>Repented o'er his doom.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Go to; let that be mine:
</br>Do you your office, or give up your place,
</br>And you shall well be spared.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I crave your honour's pardon.
</br>What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
</br>She's very near her hour.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Dispose of her
</br>To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
</br>Desires access to you.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Hath he a sister?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
</br>And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
</br>If not already.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Well, let her be admitted.
</br>See you the fornicatress be removed:
</br>Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
</br>There shall be order for't.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>God save your honour!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Stay a little while.
</br>You're welcome: what's your will?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
</br>Please but your honour hear me.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Well; what's your suit?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>There is a vice that most I do abhor,
</br>And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
</br>For which I would not plead, but that I must;
</br>For which I must not plead, but that I am
</br>At war 'twixt will and will not.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Well; the matter?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
</br>I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
</br>And not my brother.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
</br>Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
</br>Mine were the very cipher of a function,
</br>To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
</br>And let go by the actor.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O just but severe law!
</br>I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Must he needs die?
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Maiden, no remedy.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
</br>And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>I will not do't.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>But can you, if you would?
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
</br>If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
</br>As mine is to him?
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>He's sentenced; 'tis too late.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
</br>May call it back again. Well, believe this,
</br>No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
</br>Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
</br>The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
</br>Become them with one half so good a grace
</br>As mercy does.
</br>If he had been as you and you as he,
</br>You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
</br>Would not have been so stern.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Pray you, be gone.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I would to heaven I had your potency,
</br>And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
</br>No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
</br>And what a prisoner.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
</br>And you but waste your words.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Alas, alas!
</br>Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
</br>And He that might the vantage best have took
</br>Found out the remedy. How would you be,
</br>If He, which is the top of judgment, should
</br>But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
</br>And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
</br>Like man new made.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Be you content, fair maid;
</br>It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
</br>Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
</br>It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
</br>He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
</br>We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
</br>With less respect than we do minister
</br>To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
</br>Who is it that hath died for this offence?
</br>There's many have committed it.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
</br>Those many had not dared to do that evil,
</br>If the first that did the edict infringe
</br>Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
</br>Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
</br>Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
</br>Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
</br>And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
</br>Are now to have no successive degrees,
</br>But, ere they live, to end.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Yet show some pity.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>I show it most of all when I show justice;
</br>For then I pity those I do not know,
</br>Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
</br>And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
</br>Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
</br>Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
</br>And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
</br>To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
</br>To use it like a giant.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Could great men thunder
</br>As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
</br>For every pelting, petty officer
</br>Would use his heaven for thunder;
</br>Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
</br>Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
</br>Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
</br>Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
</br>Drest in a little brief authority,
</br>Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
</br>His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
</br>Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
</br>As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
</br>Would all themselves laugh mortal.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
</br>Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
</br>But in the less foul profanation.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>That in the captain's but a choleric word,
</br>Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Why do you put these sayings upon me?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Because authority, though it err like others,
</br>Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
</br>That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
</br>Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
</br>That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
</br>A natural guiltiness such as is his,
</br>Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
</br>Against my brother's life.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Gentle my lord, turn back.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>How! bribe me?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
</br>Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
</br>As fancy values them; but with true prayers
</br>That shall be up at heaven and enter there
</br>Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
</br>From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
</br>To nothing temporal.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Well; come to me to-morrow.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Heaven keep your honour safe!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>At what hour to-morrow
</br>Shall I attend your lordship?
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>At any time 'fore noon.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>'Save your honour!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>From thee, even from thy virtue!
</br>What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
</br>The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
</br>Ha!
</br>Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
</br>That, lying by the violet in the sun,
</br>Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
</br>Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
</br>That modesty may more betray our sense
</br>Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
</br>Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
</br>And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
</br>What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
</br>Dost thou desire her foully for those things
</br>That make her good? O, let her brother live!
</br>Thieves for their robbery have authority
</br>When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
</br>That I desire to hear her speak again,
</br>And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
</br>O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
</br>With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
</br>Is that temptation that doth goad us on
</br>To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
</br>With all her double vigour, art and nature,
</br>Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
</br>Subdues me quite. Even till now,
</br>When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Bound by my charity and my blest order,
</br>I come to visit the afflicted spirits
</br>Here in the prison. Do me the common right
</br>To let me see them and to make me know
</br>The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
</br>To them accordingly.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I would do more than that, if more were needful.
</br>Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
</br>Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
</br>Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
</br>And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
</br>More fit to do another such offence
</br>Than die for this.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>When must he die?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>As I do think, to-morrow.
</br>I have provided for you: stay awhile,
</br>And you shall be conducted.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
</br>And try your penitence, if it be sound,
</br>Or hollowly put on.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I'll gladly learn.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Love you the man that wrong'd you?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>So then it seems your most offenceful act
</br>Was mutually committed?
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Mutually.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I do confess it, and repent it, father.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
</br>As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
</br>Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
</br>Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
</br>But as we stand in fear,--
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>I do repent me, as it is an evil,
</br>And take the shame with joy.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>There rest.
</br>Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
</br>And I am going with instruction to him.
</br>Grace go with you, Benedicite!
</br>
</br>JULIET:
</br>Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
</br>That respites me a life, whose very comfort
</br>Is still a dying horror!
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>'Tis pity of him.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>When I would pray and think, I think and pray
</br>To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
</br>Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
</br>Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
</br>As if I did but only chew his name;
</br>And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
</br>Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
</br>Is like a good thing, being often read,
</br>Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
</br>Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
</br>Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
</br>Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
</br>How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
</br>Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
</br>To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
</br>Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
</br>'Tis not the devil's crest.
</br>How now! who's there?
</br>
</br>Servant:
</br>One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Teach her the way.
</br>O heavens!
</br>Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
</br>Making both it unable for itself,
</br>And dispossessing all my other parts
</br>Of necessary fitness?
</br>So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
</br>Come all to help him, and so stop the air
</br>By which he should revive: and even so
</br>The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
</br>Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
</br>Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
</br>Must needs appear offence.
</br>How now, fair maid?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I am come to know your pleasure.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>That you might know it, would much better please me
</br>Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
</br>As long as you or I yet he must die.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Under your sentence?
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Yea.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
</br>Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
</br>That his soul sicken not.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
</br>To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
</br>A man already made, as to remit
</br>Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
</br>In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
</br>Falsely to take away a life true made
</br>As to put metal in restrained means
</br>To make a false one.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
</br>Which had you rather, that the most just law
</br>Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
</br>Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
</br>As she that he hath stain'd?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Sir, believe this,
</br>I had rather give my body than my soul.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
</br>Stand more for number than for accompt.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>How say you?
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
</br>Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
</br>I, now the voice of the recorded law,
</br>Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
</br>Might there not be a charity in sin
</br>To save this brother's life?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Please you to do't,
</br>I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
</br>It is no sin at all, but charity.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
</br>Were equal poise of sin and charity.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
</br>Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
</br>If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
</br>To have it added to the faults of mine,
</br>And nothing of your answer.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Nay, but hear me.
</br>Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
</br>Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
</br>But graciously to know I am no better.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
</br>When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
</br>Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
</br>Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
</br>To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
</br>Your brother is to die.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>So.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>And his offence is so, as it appears,
</br>Accountant to the law upon that pain.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>True.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Admit no other way to save his life,--
</br>As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
</br>But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
</br>Finding yourself desired of such a person,
</br>Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
</br>Could fetch your brother from the manacles
</br>Of the all-building law; and that there were
</br>No earthly mean to save him, but that either
</br>You must lay down the treasures of your body
</br>To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
</br>What would you do?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>As much for my poor brother as myself:
</br>That is, were I under the terms of death,
</br>The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
</br>And strip myself to death, as to a bed
</br>That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
</br>My body up to shame.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Then must your brother die.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>And 'twere the cheaper way:
</br>Better it were a brother died at once,
</br>Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
</br>Should die for ever.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
</br>That you have slander'd so?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
</br>Are of two houses: lawful mercy
</br>Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
</br>And rather proved the sliding of your brother
</br>A merriment than a vice.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
</br>To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
</br>I something do excuse the thing I hate,
</br>For his advantage that I dearly love.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>We are all frail.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Else let my brother die,
</br>If not a feodary, but only he
</br>Owe and succeed thy weakness.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Nay, women are frail too.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
</br>Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
</br>Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
</br>In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
</br>For we are soft as our complexions are,
</br>And credulous to false prints.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>I think it well:
</br>And from this testimony of your own sex,--
</br>Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
</br>Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
</br>I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
</br>That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
</br>If you be one, as you are well express'd
</br>By all external warrants, show it now,
</br>By putting on the destined livery.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
</br>Let me entreat you speak the former language.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Plainly conceive, I love you.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>My brother did love Juliet,
</br>And you tell me that he shall die for it.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
</br>Which seems a little fouler than it is,
</br>To pluck on others.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Believe me, on mine honour,
</br>My words express my purpose.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Ha! little honour to be much believed,
</br>And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
</br>I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
</br>Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
</br>Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
</br>What man thou art.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Who will believe thee, Isabel?
</br>My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
</br>My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
</br>Will so your accusation overweigh,
</br>That you shall stifle in your own report
</br>And smell of calumny. I have begun,
</br>And now I give my sensual race the rein:
</br>Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
</br>Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
</br>That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
</br>By yielding up thy body to my will;
</br>Or else he must not only die the death,
</br>But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
</br>To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
</br>Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
</br>I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
</br>Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
</br>Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
</br>That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
</br>Either of condemnation or approof;
</br>Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
</br>Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
</br>To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
</br>Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
</br>Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
</br>That, had he twenty heads to tender down
</br>On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
</br>Before his sister should her body stoop
</br>To such abhorr'd pollution.
</br>Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
</br>More than our brother is our chastity.
</br>I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
</br>And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>The miserable have no other medicine
</br>But only hope:
</br>I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Be absolute for death; either death or life
</br>Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
</br>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
</br>That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
</br>Servile to all the skyey influences,
</br>That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
</br>Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
</br>For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
</br>And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
</br>For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
</br>Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
</br>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
</br>Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
</br>And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
</br>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
</br>For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
</br>That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
</br>For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
</br>And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
</br>For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
</br>After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
</br>For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
</br>Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
</br>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
</br>For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
</br>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
</br>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
</br>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
</br>But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
</br>Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
</br>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
</br>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
</br>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
</br>To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
</br>That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
</br>Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
</br>That makes these odds all even.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>I humbly thank you.
</br>To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
</br>And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Most holy sir, I thank you.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>My business is a word or two with Claudio.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Provost, a word with you.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>As many as you please.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Now, sister, what's the comfort?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Why,
</br>As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
</br>Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
</br>Intends you for his swift ambassador,
</br>Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
</br>Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
</br>To-morrow you set on.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Is there no remedy?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
</br>To cleave a heart in twain.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>But is there any?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Yes, brother, you may live:
</br>There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
</br>If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
</br>But fetter you till death.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Perpetual durance?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
</br>Though all the world's vastidity you had,
</br>To a determined scope.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>But in what nature?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>In such a one as, you consenting to't,
</br>Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
</br>And leave you naked.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Let me know the point.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
</br>Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
</br>And six or seven winters more respect
</br>Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
</br>The sense of death is most in apprehension;
</br>And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
</br>In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
</br>As when a giant dies.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Why give you me this shame?
</br>Think you I can a resolution fetch
</br>From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
</br>I will encounter darkness as a bride,
</br>And hug it in mine arms.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>There spake my brother; there my father's grave
</br>Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
</br>Thou art too noble to conserve a life
</br>In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
</br>Whose settled visage and deliberate word
</br>Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
</br>As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
</br>His filth within being cast, he would appear
</br>A pond as deep as hell.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>The prenzie Angelo!
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
</br>The damned'st body to invest and cover
</br>In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
</br>If I would yield him my virginity,
</br>Thou mightst be freed.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>O heavens! it cannot be.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
</br>So to offend him still. This night's the time
</br>That I should do what I abhor to name,
</br>Or else thou diest to-morrow.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Thou shalt not do't.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, were it but my life,
</br>I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
</br>As frankly as a pin.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Thanks, dear Isabel.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Yes. Has he affections in him,
</br>That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
</br>When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
</br>Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Which is the least?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>If it were damnable, he being so wise,
</br>Why would he for the momentary trick
</br>Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>What says my brother?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Death is a fearful thing.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>And shamed life a hateful.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
</br>To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
</br>This sensible warm motion to become
</br>A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
</br>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
</br>In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
</br>To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
</br>And blown with restless violence round about
</br>The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
</br>Of those that lawless and incertain thought
</br>Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
</br>The weariest and most loathed worldly life
</br>That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
</br>Can lay on nature is a paradise
</br>To what we fear of death.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Alas, alas!
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Sweet sister, let me live:
</br>What sin you do to save a brother's life,
</br>Nature dispenses with the deed so far
</br>That it becomes a virtue.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O you beast!
</br>O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
</br>Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
</br>Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
</br>From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
</br>Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
</br>For such a warped slip of wilderness
</br>Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
</br>Die, perish! Might but my bending down
</br>Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
</br>I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
</br>No word to save thee.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Nay, hear me, Isabel.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, fie, fie, fie!
</br>Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
</br>Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
</br>'Tis best thou diest quickly.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>O hear me, Isabella!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>What is your will?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
</br>by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
</br>would require is likewise your own benefit.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
</br>stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
</br>and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
</br>corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
</br>virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
</br>of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
</br>hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
</br>glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
</br>know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
</br>death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
</br>that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
</br>your knees and make ready.
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
</br>with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Hold you there: farewell.
</br>Provost, a word with you!
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>What's your will, father
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
</br>awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
</br>habit no loss shall touch her by my company.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>In good time.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
</br>the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
</br>brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
</br>your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
</br>fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
</br>fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
</br>that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
</br>wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
</br>substitute, and to save your brother?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
</br>brother die by the law than my son should be
</br>unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
</br>deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
</br>speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
</br>discover his government.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
</br>now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
</br>trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
</br>advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
</br>remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
</br>that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
</br>lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
</br>the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
</br>person; and much please the absent duke, if
</br>peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
</br>this business.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
</br>anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
</br>you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
</br>Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
</br>to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
</br>which time of the contract and limit of the
</br>solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
</br>having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
</br>sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
</br>poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
</br>renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
</br>kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
</br>her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
</br>combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
</br>with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
</br>pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
</br>bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
</br>wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
</br>is washed with them, but relents not.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
</br>from the world! What corruption in this life, that
</br>it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
</br>cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
</br>you from dishonour in doing it.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Show me how, good father.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
</br>of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
</br>in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
</br>like an impediment in the current, made it more
</br>violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
</br>requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
</br>his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
</br>this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
</br>not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
</br>silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
</br>This being granted in course,--and now follows
</br>all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
</br>your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
</br>acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
</br>her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
</br>saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
</br>advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
</br>will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
</br>think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
</br>of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
</br>What think you of it?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>The image of it gives me content already; and I
</br>trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
</br>to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
</br>bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
</br>presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
</br>grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
</br>place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
</br>it may be quickly.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
</br>needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
</br>shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>O heavens! what stuff is here
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
</br>merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
</br>order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
</br>furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
</br>craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>And you, good brother father. What offence hath
</br>this man made you, sir?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
</br>take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
</br>upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
</br>sent to the deputy.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
</br>The evil that thou causest to be done,
</br>That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
</br>What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
</br>From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
</br>From their abominable and beastly touches
</br>I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
</br>Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
</br>So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
</br>sir, I would prove--
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
</br>Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
</br>Correction and instruction must both work
</br>Ere this rude beast will profit.
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
</br>warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
</br>he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
</br>as good go a mile on his errand.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>That we were all, as some would seem to be,
</br>From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
</br>friend of mine.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
</br>Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
</br>none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
</br>had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
</br>extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
</br>sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
</br>not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
</br>thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
</br>the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
</br>trick of it?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Still thus, and thus; still worse!
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
</br>still, ha?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
</br>is herself in the tub.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
</br>so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
</br>an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
</br>to prison, Pompey?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Yes, faith, sir.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
</br>sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
</br>due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
</br>doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
</br>Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
</br>Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
</br>will keep the house.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
</br>I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
</br>you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
</br>more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>And you.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Come your ways, sir; come.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>You will not bail me, then, sir?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
</br>what news?
</br>
</br>ELBOW:
</br>Come your ways, sir; come.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
</br>What news, friar, of the duke?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I know none. Can you tell me of any?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
</br>some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
</br>the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
</br>to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
</br>puts transgression to 't.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>He does well in 't.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
</br>him: something too crabbed that way, friar.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
</br>it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
</br>it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
</br>down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
</br>woman after this downright way of creation: is it
</br>true, think you?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>How should he be made, then?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
</br>was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
</br>certain that when he makes water his urine is
</br>congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
</br>motion generative; that's infallible.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
</br>rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
</br>man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
</br>Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
</br>hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
</br>a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
</br>knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I never heard the absent duke much detected for
</br>women; he was not inclined that way.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>O, sir, you are deceived.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>'Tis not possible.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
</br>his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
</br>duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
</br>that let me inform you.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You do him wrong, surely.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
</br>duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
</br>withdrawing.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>What, I prithee, might be the cause?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
</br>teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
</br>understand, the greater file of the subject held the
</br>duke to be wise.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Wise! why, no question but he was.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
</br>the very stream of his life and the business he hath
</br>helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
</br>proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
</br>bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
</br>envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
</br>Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
</br>knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Sir, I know him, and I love him.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
</br>dearer love.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Come, sir, I know what I know.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
</br>you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
</br>prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
</br>answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
</br>you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
</br>upon you; and, I pray you, your name?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
</br>report you.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I fear you not.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
</br>imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
</br>can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
</br>friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
</br>Claudio die to-morrow or no?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Why should he die, sir?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
</br>the duke we talk of were returned again: the
</br>ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
</br>continency; sparrows must not build in his
</br>house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
</br>yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
</br>never bring them to light: would he were returned!
</br>Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
</br>Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
</br>duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
</br>Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
</br>he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
</br>bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>No might nor greatness in mortality
</br>Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
</br>The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
</br>Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
</br>But who comes here?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Go; away with her to prison!
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
</br>a merciful man; good my lord.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
</br>the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
</br>the tyrant.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
</br>your honour.
</br>
</br>MISTRESS OVERDONE:
</br>My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
</br>Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
</br>duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
</br>is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
</br>I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
</br>called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
</br>no more words.
</br>Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
</br>Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
</br>with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
</br>if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
</br>so with him.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
</br>advised him for the entertainment of death.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Good even, good father.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Bliss and goodness on you!
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Of whence are you?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Not of this country, though my chance is now
</br>To use it for my time: I am a brother
</br>Of gracious order, late come from the See
</br>In special business from his holiness.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>What news abroad i' the world?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>None, but that there is so great a fever on
</br>goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
</br>novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
</br>to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
</br>to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
</br>truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
</br>security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
</br>upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
</br>news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
</br>pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>One that, above all other strifes, contended
</br>especially to know himself.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>What pleasure was he given to?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
</br>any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
</br>gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
</br>his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
</br>and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
</br>prepared. I am made to understand that you have
</br>lent him visitation.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>He professes to have received no sinister measure
</br>from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
</br>to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
</br>to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
</br>deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
</br>leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
</br>resolved to die.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>You have paid the heavens your function, and the
</br>prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
</br>laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
</br>shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
</br>found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
</br>he is indeed Justice.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>If his own life answer the straitness of his
</br>proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
</br>chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Peace be with you!
</br>He who the sword of heaven will bear
</br>Should be as holy as severe;
</br>Pattern in himself to know,
</br>Grace to stand, and virtue go;
</br>More nor less to others paying
</br>Than by self-offences weighing.
</br>Shame to him whose cruel striking
</br>Kills for faults of his own liking!
</br>Twice treble shame on Angelo,
</br>To weed my vice and let his grow!
</br>O, what may man within him hide,
</br>Though angel on the outward side!
</br>How may likeness made in crimes,
</br>Making practise on the times,
</br>To draw with idle spiders' strings
</br>Most ponderous and substantial things!
</br>Craft against vice I must apply:
</br>With Angelo to-night shall lie
</br>His old betrothed but despised;
</br>So disguise shall, by the disguised,
</br>Pay with falsehood false exacting,
</br>And perform an old contracting.
</br>
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
</br>Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
</br>Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
</br>I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
</br>You had not found me here so musical:
</br>Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
</br>My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
</br>To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
</br>I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
</br>for me here to-day? much upon this time have
</br>I promised here to meet.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>You have not been inquired after:
</br>I have sat here all day.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
</br>now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
</br>be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>I am always bound to you.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Very well met, and well come.
</br>What is the news from this good deputy?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>He hath a garden circummured with brick,
</br>Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
</br>And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
</br>That makes his opening with this bigger key:
</br>This other doth command a little door
</br>Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
</br>There have I made my promise
</br>Upon the heavy middle of the night
</br>To call upon him.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
</br>With whispering and most guilty diligence,
</br>In action all of precept, he did show me
</br>The way twice o'er.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Are there no other tokens
</br>Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
</br>And that I have possess'd him my most stay
</br>Can be but brief; for I have made him know
</br>I have a servant comes with me along,
</br>That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
</br>I come about my brother.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>'Tis well borne up.
</br>I have not yet made known to Mariana
</br>A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
</br>I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
</br>She comes to do you good.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I do desire the like.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
</br>Who hath a story ready for your ear.
</br>I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
</br>The vaporous night approaches.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Will't please you walk aside?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
</br>Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
</br>Run with these false and most contrarious quests
</br>Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
</br>Make thee the father of their idle dreams
</br>And rack thee in their fancies.
</br>Welcome, how agreed?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
</br>If you advise it.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>It is not my consent,
</br>But my entreaty too.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Little have you to say
</br>When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
</br>'Remember now my brother.'
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Fear me not.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
</br>He is your husband on a pre-contract:
</br>To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
</br>Sith that the justice of your title to him
</br>Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
</br>Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
</br>married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
</br>cut off a woman's head.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
</br>direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
</br>and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
</br>executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
</br>you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
</br>redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
</br>your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
</br>with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
</br>notorious bawd.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
</br>but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
</br>would be glad to receive some instruction from my
</br>fellow partner.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Do you call, sir?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
</br>your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
</br>him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
</br>not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
</br>cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
</br>the scale.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
</br>good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
</br>look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Ay, sir; a mystery
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
</br>your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
</br>using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
</br>but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
</br>should be hanged, I cannot imagine.
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Sir, it is a mystery.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Proof?
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
</br>too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
</br>big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
</br>thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
</br>apparel fits your thief.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Are you agreed?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
</br>a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
</br>oftener ask forgiveness.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
</br>to-morrow four o'clock.
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
</br>occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
</br>me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
</br>a good turn.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
</br>The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
</br>Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
</br>Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
</br>'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
</br>Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
</br>
</br>CLAUDIO:
</br>As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
</br>When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
</br>He will not wake.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Who can do good on him?
</br>Well, go, prepare yourself.
</br>But, hark, what noise?
</br>Heaven give your spirits comfort!
</br>By and by.
</br>I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
</br>For the most gentle Claudio.
</br>Welcome father.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
</br>Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>None, since the curfew rung.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Not Isabel?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>No.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>They will, then, ere't be long.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>What comfort is for Claudio?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>There's some in hope.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>It is a bitter deputy.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
</br>Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
</br>He doth with holy abstinence subdue
</br>That in himself which he spurs on his power
</br>To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
</br>Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
</br>But this being so, he's just.
</br>Now are they come.
</br>This is a gentle provost: seldom when
</br>The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
</br>How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
</br>That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>There he must stay until the officer
</br>Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
</br>But he must die to-morrow?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>None, sir, none.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
</br>You shall hear more ere morning.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Happily
</br>You something know; yet I believe there comes
</br>No countermand; no such example have we:
</br>Besides, upon the very siege of justice
</br>Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
</br>Profess'd the contrary.
</br>This is his lordship's man.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>And here comes Claudio's pardon.
</br>
</br>Messenger:
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I shall obey him.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
</br>in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
</br>putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Pray you, let's hear.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
</br>afternoon?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
</br>that is a prisoner nine years old.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>How came it that the absent duke had not either
</br>delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
</br>have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
</br>indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
</br>Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>It is now apparent?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
</br>seems he to be touched?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
</br>as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
</br>of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
</br>mortality, and desperately mortal.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>He wants advice.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
</br>of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
</br>would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
</br>entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
</br>to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
</br>warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
</br>provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
</br>truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
</br>boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
</br>Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
</br>no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
</br>sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
</br>manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
</br>for the which you are to do me both a present and a
</br>dangerous courtesy.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Pray, sir, in what?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>In the delaying death.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
</br>and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
</br>his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
</br>as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
</br>instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
</br>be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
</br>Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
</br>the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
</br>death: you know the course is common. If any thing
</br>fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
</br>fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
</br>against it with my life.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>To him, and to his substitutes.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
</br>avouch the justice of your dealing?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>But what likelihood is in that?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
</br>you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
</br>persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
</br>further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
</br>Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
</br>duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
</br>signet is not strange to you.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I know them both.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
</br>shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
</br>shall find, within these two days he will be here.
</br>This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
</br>very day receives letters of strange tenor;
</br>perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
</br>into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
</br>is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
</br>shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
</br>things should be: all difficulties are but easy
</br>when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
</br>with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
</br>shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
</br>are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
</br>Come away; it is almost clear dawn.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
</br>of profession: one would think it were Mistress
</br>Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
</br>customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
</br>for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
</br>ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
</br>five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
</br>much in request, for the old women were all dead.
</br>Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
</br>Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
</br>peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
</br>beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
</br>Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
</br>Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
</br>Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
</br>Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
</br>great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
</br>Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
</br>our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
</br>Master Barnardine!
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>What, ho, Barnardine!
</br>
</br>BARNARDINE:
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
</br>good, sir, to rise and be put to death.
</br>
</br>BARNARDINE:
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
</br>executed, and sleep afterwards.
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Go in to him, and fetch him out.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>Very ready, sir.
</br>
</br>BARNARDINE:
</br>How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
</br>prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.
</br>
</br>BARNARDINE:
</br>You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
</br>fitted for 't.
</br>
</br>POMPEY:
</br>O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
</br>and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
</br>sounder all the next day.
</br>
</br>ABHORSON:
</br>Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
</br>we jest now, think you?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
</br>you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
</br>you and pray with you.
</br>
</br>BARNARDINE:
</br>Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
</br>and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
</br>shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
</br>consent to die this day, that's certain.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
</br>Look forward on the journey you shall go.
</br>
</br>BARNARDINE:
</br>I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
</br>persuasion.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>But hear you.
</br>
</br>BARNARDINE:
</br>Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
</br>come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
</br>After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
</br>And to transport him in the mind he is
</br>Were damnable.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Here in the prison, father,
</br>There died this morning of a cruel fever
</br>One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
</br>A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
</br>Just of his colour. What if we do omit
</br>This reprobate till he were well inclined;
</br>And satisfy the deputy with the visage
</br>Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
</br>Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
</br>Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
</br>And sent according to command; whiles I
</br>Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>This shall be done, good father, presently.
</br>But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
</br>And how shall we continue Claudio,
</br>To save me from the danger that might come
</br>If he were known alive?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Let this be done.
</br>Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
</br>Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
</br>To the under generation, you shall find
</br>Your safety manifested.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I am your free dependant.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
</br>Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
</br>The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
</br>Shall witness to him I am near at home,
</br>And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
</br>To enter publicly: him I'll desire
</br>To meet me at the consecrated fount
</br>A league below the city; and from thence,
</br>By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
</br>We shall proceed with Angelo.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
</br>For I would commune with you of such things
</br>That want no ear but yours.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>I'll make all speed.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
</br>If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
</br>But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
</br>To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
</br>When it is least expected.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Ho, by your leave!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>The better, given me by so holy a man.
</br>Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
</br>His head is off and sent to Angelo.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Nay, but it is not so.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
</br>In your close patience.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You shall not be admitted to his sight.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
</br>Injurious world! most damned Angelo!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
</br>Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
</br>Mark what I say, which you shall find
</br>By every syllable a faithful verity:
</br>The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
</br>One of our convent, and his confessor,
</br>Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
</br>Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
</br>Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
</br>There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
</br>In that good path that I would wish it go,
</br>And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
</br>Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
</br>And general honour.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I am directed by you.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
</br>'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
</br>Say, by this token, I desire his company
</br>At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
</br>I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
</br>Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
</br>Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
</br>I am combined by a sacred vow
</br>And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
</br>Command these fretting waters from your eyes
</br>With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
</br>If I pervert your course. Who's here?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Good even. Friar, where's the provost?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Not within, sir.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
</br>thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
</br>to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
</br>my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
</br>me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
</br>to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
</br>if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
</br>at home, he had lived.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
</br>reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
</br>he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
</br>I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
</br>they be true; if not true, none were enough.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Did you such a thing?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
</br>they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
</br>if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
</br>it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
</br>show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
</br>not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
</br>redeliver our authorities there
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I guess not.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
</br>entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
</br>they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
</br>complaints, and to deliver us from devices
</br>hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
</br>against us.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
</br>i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
</br>notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
</br>him.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I shall, sir. Fare you well.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Good night.
</br>This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
</br>And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
</br>And by an eminent body that enforced
</br>The law against it! But that her tender shame
</br>Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
</br>How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
</br>For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
</br>That no particular scandal once can touch
</br>But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
</br>Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
</br>Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
</br>By so receiving a dishonour'd life
</br>With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
</br>A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
</br>Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>These letters at fit time deliver me
</br>The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
</br>The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
</br>And hold you ever to our special drift;
</br>Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
</br>As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
</br>And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
</br>To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
</br>And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
</br>But send me Flavius first.
</br>
</br>FRIAR PETER:
</br>It shall be speeded well.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
</br>Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
</br>Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>To speak so indirectly I am loath:
</br>I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
</br>That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
</br>He says, to veil full purpose.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Be ruled by him.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
</br>He speak against me on the adverse side,
</br>I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
</br>That's bitter to sweet end.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>I would Friar Peter--
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, peace! the friar is come.
</br>
</br>FRIAR PETER:
</br>Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
</br>Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
</br>He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
</br>The generous and gravest citizens
</br>Have hent the gates, and very near upon
</br>The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
</br>Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Happy return be to your royal grace!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Many and hearty thankings to you both.
</br>We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
</br>Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
</br>Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
</br>Forerunning more requital.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>You make my bonds still greater.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
</br>To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
</br>When it deserves, with characters of brass,
</br>A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
</br>And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
</br>And let the subject see, to make them know
</br>That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
</br>Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
</br>You must walk by us on our other hand;
</br>And good supporters are you.
</br>
</br>FRIAR PETER:
</br>Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
</br>Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
</br>O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
</br>By throwing it on any other object
</br>Till you have heard me in my true complaint
</br>And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
</br>Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
</br>Reveal yourself to him.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O worthy duke,
</br>You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
</br>Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
</br>Must either punish me, not being believed,
</br>Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
</br>She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
</br>Cut off by course of justice,--
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>By course of justice!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
</br>That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
</br>That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
</br>That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
</br>An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
</br>Is it not strange and strange?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Nay, it is ten times strange.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>It is not truer he is Angelo
</br>Than this is all as true as it is strange:
</br>Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
</br>To the end of reckoning.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Away with her! Poor soul,
</br>She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
</br>There is another comfort than this world,
</br>That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
</br>That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
</br>That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
</br>But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
</br>May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
</br>As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
</br>In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
</br>Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
</br>If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
</br>Had I more name for badness.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>By mine honesty,
</br>If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
</br>Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
</br>Such a dependency of thing on thing,
</br>As e'er I heard in madness.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O gracious duke,
</br>Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
</br>For inequality; but let your reason serve
</br>To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
</br>And hide the false seems true.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Many that are not mad
</br>Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I am the sister of one Claudio,
</br>Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
</br>To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
</br>I, in probation of a sisterhood,
</br>Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
</br>As then the messenger,--
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>That's I, an't like your grace:
</br>I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
</br>To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
</br>For her poor brother's pardon.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>That's he indeed.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You were not bid to speak.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>No, my good lord;
</br>Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I wish you now, then;
</br>Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
</br>A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
</br>Be perfect.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>I warrant your honour.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Right.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
</br>To speak before your time. Proceed.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I went
</br>To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>That's somewhat madly spoken.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Pardon it;
</br>The phrase is to the matter.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Mended again. The matter; proceed.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>In brief, to set the needless process by,
</br>How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
</br>How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
</br>For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
</br>I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
</br>He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
</br>To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
</br>Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
</br>My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
</br>And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
</br>His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
</br>For my poor brother's head.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>This is most likely!
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, that it were as like as it is true!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
</br>Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
</br>In hateful practise. First, his integrity
</br>Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
</br>That with such vehemency he should pursue
</br>Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
</br>He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
</br>And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
</br>Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
</br>Thou camest here to complain.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>And is this all?
</br>Then, O you blessed ministers above,
</br>Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
</br>Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
</br>In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
</br>As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
</br>To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
</br>A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
</br>On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
</br>Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
</br>I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
</br>For certain words he spake against your grace
</br>In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
</br>And to set on this wretched woman here
</br>Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
</br>I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
</br>A very scurvy fellow.
</br>
</br>FRIAR PETER:
</br>Blessed be your royal grace!
</br>I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
</br>Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
</br>Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
</br>Who is as free from touch or soil with her
</br>As she from one ungot.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>We did believe no less.
</br>Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
</br>
</br>FRIAR PETER:
</br>I know him for a man divine and holy;
</br>Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
</br>As he's reported by this gentleman;
</br>And, on my trust, a man that never yet
</br>Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>My lord, most villanously; believe it.
</br>
</br>FRIAR PETER:
</br>Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
</br>But at this instant he is sick my lord,
</br>Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
</br>Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
</br>Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
</br>To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
</br>Is true and false; and what he with his oath
</br>And all probation will make up full clear,
</br>Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
</br>To justify this worthy nobleman,
</br>So vulgarly and personally accused,
</br>Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
</br>Till she herself confess it.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Good friar, let's hear it.
</br>Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
</br>O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
</br>Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
</br>In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
</br>Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
</br>First, let her show her face, and after speak.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
</br>Until my husband bid me.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>What, are you married?
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>No, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Are you a maid?
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>No, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>A widow, then?
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Neither, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
</br>neither maid, widow, nor wife.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
</br>To prattle for himself.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Well, my lord.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
</br>And I confess besides I am no maid:
</br>I have known my husband; yet my husband
</br>Knows not that ever he knew me.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Well, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Now I come to't my lord
</br>She that accuses him of fornication,
</br>In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
</br>And charges him my lord, with such a time
</br>When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
</br>With all the effect of love.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Charges she more than me?
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Not that I know.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>No? you say your husband.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
</br>Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
</br>But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
</br>This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
</br>Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
</br>This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
</br>Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
</br>That took away the match from Isabel,
</br>And did supply thee at thy garden-house
</br>In her imagined person.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Know you this woman?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Carnally, she says.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Sirrah, no more!
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Enough, my lord.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
</br>And five years since there was some speech of marriage
</br>Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
</br>Partly for that her promised proportions
</br>Came short of composition, but in chief
</br>For that her reputation was disvalued
</br>In levity: since which time of five years
</br>I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
</br>Upon my faith and honour.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Noble prince,
</br>As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
</br>As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
</br>I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
</br>As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
</br>But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
</br>He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
</br>Let me in safety raise me from my knees
</br>Or else for ever be confixed here,
</br>A marble monument!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>I did but smile till now:
</br>Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
</br>My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
</br>These poor informal women are no more
</br>But instruments of some more mightier member
</br>That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
</br>To find this practise out.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Ay, with my heart
</br>And punish them to your height of pleasure.
</br>Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
</br>Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
</br>Though they would swear down each particular saint,
</br>Were testimonies against his worth and credit
</br>That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
</br>Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
</br>To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
</br>There is another friar that set them on;
</br>Let him be sent for.
</br>
</br>FRIAR PETER:
</br>Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
</br>Hath set the women on to this complaint:
</br>Your provost knows the place where he abides
</br>And he may fetch him.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Go do it instantly.
</br>And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
</br>Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
</br>Do with your injuries as seems you best,
</br>In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
</br>But stir not you till you have well determined
</br>Upon these slanderers.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>My lord, we'll do it throughly.
</br>Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
</br>Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
</br>but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
</br>villanous speeches of the duke.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
</br>enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
</br>notable fellow.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>As any in Vienna, on my word.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
</br>Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
</br>shall see how I'll handle her.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Not better than he, by her own report.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Say you?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
</br>she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
</br>she'll be ashamed.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I will go darkly to work with her.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
</br>that you have said.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
</br>the provost.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>In very good time: speak not you to him till we
</br>call upon you.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Mum.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
</br>Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>'Tis false.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>How! know you where you are?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Respect to your great place! and let the devil
</br>Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
</br>Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
</br>Look you speak justly.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
</br>Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
</br>Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
</br>Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
</br>Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
</br>And put your trial in the villain's mouth
</br>Which here you come to accuse.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
</br>Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
</br>To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
</br>And in the witness of his proper ear,
</br>To call him villain? and then to glance from him
</br>To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
</br>Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
</br>Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
</br>What 'unjust'!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Be not so hot; the duke
</br>Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
</br>Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
</br>Nor here provincial. My business in this state
</br>Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
</br>Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
</br>Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
</br>But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
</br>Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
</br>As much in mock as mark.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
</br>Is this the man that you did tell us of?
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
</br>do you know me?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
</br>met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Most notedly, sir.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
</br>fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
</br>that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
</br>much more, much worse.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
</br>nose for thy speeches?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
</br>treasonable abuses!
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
</br>him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
</br>to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
</br>speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
</br>with the other confederate companion!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
</br>bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
</br>you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
</br>show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
</br>Will't not off?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
</br>First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
</br>Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
</br>Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
</br>
</br>LUCIO:
</br>This may prove worse than hanging.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>O my dread lord,
</br>I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
</br>To think I can be undiscernible,
</br>When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
</br>Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
</br>No longer session hold upon my shame,
</br>But let my trial be mine own confession:
</br>Immediate sentence then and sequent death
</br>Is all the grace I beg.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Come hither, Mariana.
</br>Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>I was, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
</br>Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
</br>Return him here again. Go with him, provost.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
</br>Than at the strangeness of it.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Come hither, Isabel.
</br>Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
</br>Advertising and holy to your business,
</br>Not changing heart with habit, I am still
</br>Attorney'd at your service.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>O, give me pardon,
</br>That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
</br>Your unknown sovereignty!
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You are pardon'd, Isabel:
</br>And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
</br>Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
</br>And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
</br>Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
</br>Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
</br>Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
</br>It was the swift celerity of his death,
</br>Which I did think with slower foot came on,
</br>That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
</br>That life is better life, past fearing death,
</br>Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
</br>So happy is your brother.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>I do, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>For this new-married man approaching here,
</br>Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
</br>Your well defended honour, you must pardon
</br>For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
</br>Being criminal, in double violation
</br>Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
</br>Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
</br>The very mercy of the law cries out
</br>Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
</br>'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
</br>Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
</br>Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
</br>Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
</br>Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
</br>We do condemn thee to the very block
</br>Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
</br>Away with him!
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>O my most gracious lord,
</br>I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
</br>Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
</br>I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
</br>For that he knew you, might reproach your life
</br>And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
</br>Although by confiscation they are ours,
</br>We do instate and widow you withal,
</br>To buy you a better husband.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>O my dear lord,
</br>I crave no other, nor no better man.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Never crave him; we are definitive.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Gentle my liege,--
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>You do but lose your labour.
</br>Away with him to death!
</br>Now, sir, to you.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
</br>Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
</br>I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Against all sense you do importune her:
</br>Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
</br>Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
</br>And take her hence in horror.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Isabel,
</br>Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
</br>Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
</br>They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
</br>And, for the most, become much more the better
</br>For being a little bad: so may my husband.
</br>O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>He dies for Claudio's death.
</br>
</br>ISABELLA:
</br>Most bounteous sir,
</br>Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
</br>As if my brother lived: I partly think
</br>A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
</br>Till he did look on me: since it is so,
</br>Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
</br>In that he did the thing for which he died:
</br>For Angelo,
</br>His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
</br>And must be buried but as an intent
</br>That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
</br>Intents but merely thoughts.
</br>
</br>MARIANA:
</br>Merely, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
</br>I have bethought me of another fault.
</br>Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
</br>At an unusual hour?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>It was commanded so.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Had you a special warrant for the deed?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>No, my good lord; it was by private message.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>For which I do discharge you of your office:
</br>Give up your keys.
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>Pardon me, noble lord:
</br>I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
</br>Yet did repent me, after more advice;
</br>For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
</br>That should by private order else have died,
</br>I have reserved alive.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>What's he?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>His name is Barnardine.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
</br>Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
</br>
</br>ESCALUS:
</br>I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
</br>As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
</br>Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
</br>And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
</br>
</br>ANGELO:
</br>I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
</br>And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
</br>That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
</br>'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>Which is that Barnardine?
</br>
</br>Provost:
</br>This, my lord.
</br>
</br>DUKE VINCENTIO:
</br>There was a friar told me of this man.
</br>Sirrah, thou art said to
