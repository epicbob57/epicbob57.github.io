        It was the best of times,
</br>it was the worst of times,
</br>it was the age of wisdom,
</br>it was the age of foolishness,
</br>it was the epoch of belief,
</br>it was the epoch of incredulity,
</br>it was the season of Light,
</br>it was the season of Darkness,
</br>it was the spring of hope,
</br>it was the winter of despair,
</br>we had everything before us,
</br>we had nothing before us,
</br>we were all going direct to Heaven,
</br>we were all going direct the other way--
</br>in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
</br>its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
</br>evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
</br>
</br>There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
</br>throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
</br>a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
</br>than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
</br>that things in general were settled for ever.
</br>
</br>It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
</br>Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
</br>as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
</br>blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
</br>heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
</br>made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
</br>ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
</br>messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
</br>deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
</br>earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
</br>from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
</br>to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
</br>communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
</br>brood.
</br>
</br>France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
</br>sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
</br>hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
</br>Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
</br>achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
</br>torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
</br>kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
</br>which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
</br>yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
</br>Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
</br>already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
</br>boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
</br>it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
</br>of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
</br>sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
</br>rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
</br>the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
</br>the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
</br>unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
</br>with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
</br>that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
</br>
</br>In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
</br>justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
</br>highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
</br>families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
</br>their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman
</br>in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
</br>challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
</br>“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
</br>mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
</br>then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the
</br>failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;
</br>that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
</br>and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
</br>illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London
</br>gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
</br>fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
</br>thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
</br>Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search
</br>for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
</br>musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
</br>much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
</br>and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
</br>up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
</br>Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
</br>hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
</br>Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
</br>and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of
</br>sixpence.
</br>
</br>All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
</br>upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
</br>Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
</br>those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
</br>fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
</br>with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
</br>and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
</br>creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
</br>roads that lay before them.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>II. The Mail
</br>
</br>
</br>It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
</br>before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.
</br>The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
</br>Shooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,
</br>as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish
</br>for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,
</br>and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the
</br>horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the
</br>coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back
</br>to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in
</br>combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
</br>otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals
</br>are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to
</br>their duty.
</br>
</br>With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through
</br>the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were
</br>falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested
</br>them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the
</br>near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an
</br>unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the
</br>hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a
</br>nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
</br>
</br>There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
</br>forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
</br>none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the
</br>air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the
</br>waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out
</br>everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,
</br>and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
</br>into it, as if they had made it all.
</br>
</br>Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the
</br>side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
</br>ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from
</br>anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was
</br>hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from
</br>the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers
</br>were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on
</br>the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,
</br>when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in
</br>“the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
</br>non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard
</br>of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
</br>thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as
</br>he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
</br>and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
</br>loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
</br>deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
</br>
</br>The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
</br>the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they
</br>all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but
</br>the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
</br>taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the
</br>journey.
</br>
</br>“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re at the
</br>top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to
</br>it!--Joe!”
</br>
</br>“Halloa!” the guard replied.
</br>
</br>“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”
</br>
</br>“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”
</br>
</br>“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter’s
</br>yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”
</br>
</br>The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,
</br>made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
</br>suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its
</br>passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach
</br>stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three
</br>had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
</br>into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of
</br>getting shot instantly as a highwayman.
</br>
</br>The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses
</br>stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
</br>the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.
</br>
</br>“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his
</br>box.
</br>
</br>“What do you say, Tom?”
</br>
</br>They both listened.
</br>
</br>“I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”
</br>
</br>“_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold
</br>of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the king’s
</br>name, all of you!”
</br>
</br>With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on
</br>the offensive.
</br>
</br>The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;
</br>the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He
</br>remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained
</br>in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,
</br>and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked
</br>back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up
</br>his ears and looked back, without contradicting.
</br>
</br>The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
</br>of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
</br>indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
</br>the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the
</br>passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the
</br>quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding
</br>the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.
</br>
</br>The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.
</br>
</br>“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand!
</br>I shall fire!”
</br>
</br>The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
</br>a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”
</br>
</br>“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”
</br>
</br>“_Is_ that the Dover mail?”
</br>
</br>“Why do you want to know?”
</br>
</br>“I want a passenger, if it is.”
</br>
</br>“What passenger?”
</br>
</br>“Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”
</br>
</br>Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,
</br>the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.
</br>
</br>“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,
</br>“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in
</br>your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”
</br>
</br>“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering
</br>speech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”
</br>
</br>(“I don’t like Jerry’s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to
</br>himself. “He’s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)
</br>
</br>“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”
</br>
</br>“What is the matter?”
</br>
</br>“A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.”
</br>
</br>“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the
</br>road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
</br>passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and
</br>pulled up the window. “He may come close; there’s nothing wrong.”
</br>
</br>“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ‘Nation sure of that,” said the
</br>guard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”
</br>
</br>“Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.
</br>
</br>“Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters to that
</br>saddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ‘em. For I’m a devil
</br>at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So
</br>now let’s look at you.”
</br>
</br>The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,
</br>and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider
</br>stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger
</br>a small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse and
</br>rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
</br>the man.
</br>
</br>“Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.
</br>
</br>The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised
</br>blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,
</br>answered curtly, “Sir.”
</br>
</br>“There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson’s Bank. You must
</br>know Tellson’s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown
</br>to drink. I may read this?”
</br>
</br>“If so be as you’re quick, sir.”
</br>
</br>He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and
</br>read--first to himself and then aloud: “‘Wait at Dover for Mam’selle.’
</br>It’s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED
</br>TO LIFE.”
</br>
</br>Jerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,”
</br> said he, at his hoarsest.
</br>
</br>“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
</br>well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”
</br>
</br>With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at
</br>all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted
</br>their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general
</br>pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape
</br>the hazard of originating any other kind of action.
</br>
</br>The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
</br>it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
</br>in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and
</br>having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,
</br>looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a
</br>few smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was
</br>furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
</br>and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut
</br>himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,
</br>and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in
</br>five minutes.
</br>
</br>“Tom!” softly over the coach roof.
</br>
</br>“Hallo, Joe.”
</br>
</br>“Did you hear the message?”
</br>
</br>“I did, Joe.”
</br>
</br>“What did you make of it, Tom?”
</br>
</br>“Nothing at all, Joe.”
</br>
</br>“That’s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it
</br>myself.”
</br>
</br>Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not
</br>only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and
</br>shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of
</br>holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his
</br>heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
</br>hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the
</br>hill.
</br>
</br>“After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won’t trust your
</br>fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger,
</br>glancing at his mare. “‘Recalled to life.’ That’s a Blazing strange
</br>message. Much of that wouldn’t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You’d
</br>be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,
</br>Jerry!”
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>III. The Night Shadows
</br>
</br>
</br>A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
</br>constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A
</br>solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every
</br>one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
</br>room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
</br>heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of
</br>its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the
</br>awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I
</br>turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time
</br>to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable
</br>water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses
</br>of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the
</br>book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
</br>but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an
</br>eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood
</br>in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,
</br>my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable
</br>consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
</br>individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end. In
</br>any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there
</br>a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
</br>innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
</br>
</br>As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the
</br>messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
</br>first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the
</br>three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
</br>coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had
</br>been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the
</br>breadth of a county between him and the next.
</br>
</br>The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
</br>ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his
</br>own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that
</br>assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with
</br>no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they
</br>were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too
</br>far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like
</br>a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
</br>throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped
</br>for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he
</br>poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he
</br>muffled again.
</br>
</br>“No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.
</br>“It wouldn’t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn’t
</br>suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don’t think he’d
</br>been a drinking!”
</br>
</br>His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several
</br>times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,
</br>which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
</br>over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was
</br>so like Smith’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
</br>wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might
</br>have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.
</br>
</br>While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
</br>watchman in his box at the door of Tellson’s Bank, by Temple Bar, who
</br>was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
</br>night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such
</br>shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.
</br>They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.
</br>
</br>What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon
</br>its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,
</br>likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms
</br>their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.
</br>
</br>Tellson’s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank
</br>passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what
</br>lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,
</br>and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special
</br>jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little
</br>coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the
</br>bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great
</br>stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,
</br>and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with
</br>all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then
</br>the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson’s, with such of their valuable
</br>stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a
</br>little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among
</br>them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them
</br>safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.
</br>
</br>But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach
</br>(in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was
</br>always with him, there was another current of impression that never
</br>ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one
</br>out of a grave.
</br>
</br>Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
</br>was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
</br>not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
</br>years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,
</br>and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,
</br>defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
</br>so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
</br>and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
</br>prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
</br>spectre:
</br>
</br>“Buried how long?”
</br>
</br>The answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”
</br>
</br>“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”
</br>
</br>“Long ago.”
</br>
</br>“You know that you are recalled to life?”
</br>
</br>“They tell me so.”
</br>
</br>“I hope you care to live?”
</br>
</br>“I can’t say.”
</br>
</br>“Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?”
</br>
</br>The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes
</br>the broken reply was, “Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.”
</br> Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,
</br>“Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it
</br>was, “I don’t know her. I don’t understand.”
</br>
</br>After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,
</br>and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his
</br>hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
</br>hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The
</br>passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the
</br>reality of mist and rain on his cheek.
</br>
</br>Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving
</br>patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating
</br>by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
</br>of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the
</br>real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express
</br>sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out
</br>of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost
</br>it again.
</br>
</br>“Buried how long?”
</br>
</br>“Almost eighteen years.”
</br>
</br>“I hope you care to live?”
</br>
</br>“I can’t say.”
</br>
</br>Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two
</br>passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm
</br>securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two
</br>slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again
</br>slid away into the bank and the grave.
</br>
</br>“Buried how long?”
</br>
</br>“Almost eighteen years.”
</br>
</br>“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”
</br>
</br>“Long ago.”
</br>
</br>The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in
</br>his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary
</br>passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
</br>shadows of the night were gone.
</br>
</br>He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a
</br>ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
</br>last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
</br>in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
</br>upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
</br>and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.
</br>
</br>“Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. “Gracious
</br>Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!”
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>IV. The Preparation
</br>
</br>
</br>When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
</br>the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his
</br>custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey
</br>from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
</br>traveller upon.
</br>
</br>By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be
</br>congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
</br>roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
</br>and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather
</br>like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out
</br>of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and
</br>muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.
</br>
</br>“There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”
</br>
</br>“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The
</br>tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,
</br>sir?”
</br>
</br>“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”
</br>
</br>“And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.
</br>Show Concord! Gentleman’s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off
</br>gentleman’s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)
</br>Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!”
</br>
</br>The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
</br>mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
</br>head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
</br>Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,
</br>all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another
</br>drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all
</br>loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord
</br>and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a
</br>brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large
</br>square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to
</br>his breakfast.
</br>
</br>The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman
</br>in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,
</br>with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,
</br>that he might have been sitting for his portrait.
</br>
</br>Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a
</br>loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,
</br>as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
</br>evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain
</br>of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a
</br>fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He
</br>wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his
</br>head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which
</br>looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
</br>His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,
</br>was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
</br>beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A
</br>face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the
</br>quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
</br>their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and
</br>reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his
</br>cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.
</br>But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson’s Bank were
</br>principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps
</br>second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.
</br>
</br>Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,
</br>Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,
</br>and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:
</br>
</br>“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
</br>time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a
</br>gentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”
</br>
</br>“Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”
</br>
</br>“Yes.”
</br>
</br>“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
</br>their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A
</br>vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s House.”
</br>
</br>“Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”
</br>
</br>“Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
</br>sir?”
</br>
</br>“Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last
</br>from France.”
</br>
</br>“Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people’s
</br>time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”
</br>
</br>“I believe so.”
</br>
</br>“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
</br>Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen
</br>years ago?”
</br>
</br>“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from
</br>the truth.”
</br>
</br>“Indeed, sir!”
</br>
</br>Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the
</br>table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,
</br>dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while
</br>he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the
</br>immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.
</br>
</br>When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on
</br>the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
</br>from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine
</br>ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
</br>wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
</br>destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and
</br>brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong
</br>a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
</br>dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little
</br>fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by
</br>night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide
</br>made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,
</br>sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable
</br>that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
</br>
</br>As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
</br>at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
</br>again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to cloud
</br>too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting
</br>his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,
</br>digging, digging, in the live red coals.
</br>
</br>A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
</br>harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.
</br>Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last
</br>glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
</br>ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
</br>got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
</br>street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.
</br>
</br>He set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.
</br>
</br>In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette
</br>had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from
</br>Tellson’s.
</br>
</br>“So soon?”
</br>
</br>Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none
</br>then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson’s
</br>immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.
</br>
</br>The gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty his
</br>glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen
</br>wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment.
</br>It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black
</br>horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and
</br>oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
</br>were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep
</br>graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected
</br>from them until they were dug out.
</br>
</br>The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his
</br>way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for
</br>the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall
</br>candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
</br>the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,
</br>and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As
</br>his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden
</br>hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and
</br>a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth
</br>it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
</br>not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright
</br>fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his
</br>eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,
</br>of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
</br>Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
</br>high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of
</br>the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital
</br>procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were
</br>offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the
</br>feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.
</br>
</br>“Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
</br>little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.
</br>
</br>“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier
</br>date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.
</br>
</br>“I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
</br>some intelligence--or discovery--”
</br>
</br>“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”
</br>
</br>“--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so
</br>long dead--”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
</br>hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for
</br>anybody in their absurd baskets!
</br>
</br>“--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate
</br>with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for
</br>the purpose.”
</br>
</br>“Myself.”
</br>
</br>“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”
</br>
</br>She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a
</br>pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
</br>was than she. He made her another bow.
</br>
</br>“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
</br>those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to
</br>France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
</br>me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,
</br>during the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection. The
</br>gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to
</br>beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”
</br>
</br>“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I shall
</br>be more happy to execute it.”
</br>
</br>“Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me
</br>by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
</br>business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
</br>nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
</br>strong and eager interest to know what they are.”
</br>
</br>“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes--I--”
</br>
</br>After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
</br>ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”
</br>
</br>He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young
</br>forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty
</br>and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,
</br>as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing
</br>shadow.
</br>
</br>“Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”
</br>
</br>“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with
</br>an argumentative smile.
</br>
</br>Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of
</br>which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
</br>deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
</br>she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the
</br>moment she raised her eyes again, went on:
</br>
</br>“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you
</br>as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”
</br>
</br>“If you please, sir.”
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to
</br>acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than
</br>if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with
</br>your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”
</br>
</br>“Story!”
</br>
</br>He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,
</br>in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call
</br>our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific
</br>gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.”
</br>
</br>“Not of Beauvais?”
</br>
</br>“Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
</br>gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
</br>gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.
</br>Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that
</br>time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.”
</br>
</br>“At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”
</br>
</br>“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and
</br>I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other
</br>French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands.
</br>In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
</br>scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;
</br>there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like
</br>sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my
</br>business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in
</br>the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere
</br>machine. To go on--”
</br>
</br>“But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”--the
</br>curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--“that when I was
</br>left an orphan through my mother’s surviving my father only two years,
</br>it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
</br>to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then
</br>conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding
</br>the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub
</br>his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking
</br>down into her face while she sat looking up into his.
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself
</br>just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold
</br>with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect
</br>that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of
</br>Tellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of
</br>Tellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance
</br>of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
</br>Mangle.”
</br>
</br>After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry
</br>flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most
</br>unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
</br>before), and resumed his former attitude.
</br>
</br>“So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your
</br>regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died
</br>when he did--Don’t be frightened! How you start!”
</br>
</br>She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.
</br>
</br>“Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from
</br>the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
</br>him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation--a matter of
</br>business. As I was saying--”
</br>
</br>Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:
</br>
</br>“As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly
</br>and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not
</br>been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
</br>trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
</br>privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
</br>to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the
</br>privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
</br>to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had
</br>implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of
</br>him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have
</br>been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”
</br>
</br>“I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”
</br>
</br>“I will. I am going to. You can bear it?”
</br>
</br>“I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
</br>moment.”
</br>
</br>“You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That’s good!” (Though
</br>his manner was less satisfied than his words.) “A matter of business.
</br>Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now
</br>if this doctor’s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,
</br>had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
</br>born--”
</br>
</br>“The little child was a daughter, sir.”
</br>
</br>“A daughter. A-a-matter of business--don’t be distressed. Miss, if the
</br>poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,
</br>that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
</br>inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by
</br>rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don’t kneel! In
</br>Heaven’s name why should you kneel to me!”
</br>
</br>“For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”
</br>
</br>“A--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact
</br>business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly
</br>mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
</br>shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so
</br>much more at my ease about your state of mind.”
</br>
</br>Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had
</br>very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
</br>his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she
</br>communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.
</br>
</br>“That’s right, that’s right. Courage! Business! You have business before
</br>you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with
</br>you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened
</br>her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,
</br>to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud
</br>upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
</br>heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.”
</br>
</br>As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
</br>flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have
</br>been already tinged with grey.
</br>
</br>“You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
</br>they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new
</br>discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--”
</br>
</br>He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the
</br>forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was
</br>now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.
</br>
</br>“But he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too
</br>probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
</br>Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
</br>in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to
</br>restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”
</br>
</br>A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a
</br>low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,
</br>
</br>“I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. “There, there,
</br>there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.
</br>You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair
</br>sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.”
</br>
</br>She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, “I have been free, I
</br>have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!”
</br>
</br>“Only one thing more,” said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
</br>wholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under
</br>another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be
</br>worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
</br>know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
</br>held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
</br>because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,
</br>anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all
</br>events--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even
</br>Tellson’s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of
</br>the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring
</br>to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,
</br>and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, ‘Recalled to Life;’
</br>which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn’t notice a
</br>word! Miss Manette!”
</br>
</br>Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
</br>sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
</br>upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
</br>branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he
</br>feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
</br>out loudly for assistance without moving.
</br>
</br>A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to
</br>be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some
</br>extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most
</br>wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,
</br>or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the
</br>inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
</br>poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him
</br>flying back against the nearest wall.
</br>
</br>(“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry’s breathless
</br>reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)
</br>
</br>“Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.
</br>“Why don’t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring
</br>at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don’t you go and fetch
</br>things? I’ll let you know, if you don’t bring smelling-salts, cold
</br>water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”
</br>
</br>There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she
</br>softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and
</br>gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading her
</br>golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.
</br>
</br>“And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
</br>“couldn’t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her
</br>to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do
</br>you call _that_ being a Banker?”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
</br>answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
</br>sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn
</br>servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something
</br>not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a
</br>regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
</br>upon her shoulder.
</br>
</br>“I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry.
</br>
</br>“No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!”
</br>
</br>“I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
</br>humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”
</br>
</br>“A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever
</br>intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
</br>would have cast my lot in an island?”
</br>
</br>This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to
</br>consider it.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>V. The Wine-shop
</br>
</br>
</br>A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The
</br>accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
</br>out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just
</br>outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.
</br>
</br>All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
</br>idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular
</br>stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
</br>thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
</br>had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
</br>jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,
</br>made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
</br>women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
</br>run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in
</br>the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with
</br>handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’
</br>mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;
</br>others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and
</br>there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
</br>directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed
</br>pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted
</br>fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the
</br>wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up
</br>along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,
</br>if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
</br>presence.
</br>
</br>A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,
</br>and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There
</br>was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a
</br>special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part
</br>of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the
</br>luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,
</br>shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen
</br>together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been
</br>most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
</br>demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who
</br>had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in
</br>motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
</br>hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
</br>starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men
</br>with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into
</br>the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom
</br>gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.
</br>
</br>The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street
</br>in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had
</br>stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many
</br>wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks
</br>on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was
</br>stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.
</br>Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a
</br>tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his
</br>head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled
</br>upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.
</br>
</br>The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
</br>street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.
</br>
</br>And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary
</br>gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was
</br>heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
</br>waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;
</br>but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a
</br>terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the
</br>fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,
</br>passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered
</br>in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which
</br>had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the
</br>children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the
</br>grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
</br>was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out
</br>of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
</br>lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
</br>paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
</br>firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless
</br>chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,
</br>among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the
</br>baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
</br>bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
</br>was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
</br>chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
</br>farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
</br>drops of oil.
</br>
</br>Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding
</br>street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
</br>diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
</br>and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
</br>that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
</br>wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and
</br>slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor
</br>compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted
</br>into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or
</br>inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)
</br>were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman
</br>painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of
</br>meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,
</br>croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were
</br>gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a
</br>flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives
</br>and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and the
</br>gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,
</br>with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but
</br>broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down
</br>the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
</br>rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across
</br>the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
</br>pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,
</br>and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
</br>manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and
</br>the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.
</br>
</br>For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
</br>should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
</br>long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling
</br>up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
</br>condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over
</br>France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of
</br>song and feather, took no warning.
</br>
</br>The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its
</br>appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
</br>it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
</br>for the lost wine. “It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug
</br>of the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring
</br>another.”
</br>
</br>There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,
</br>he called to him across the way:
</br>
</br>“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”
</br>
</br>The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often
</br>the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
</br>often the way with his tribe too.
</br>
</br>“What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop
</br>keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of
</br>mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you write
</br>in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place
</br>to write such words in?”
</br>
</br>In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,
</br>perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart. The joker rapped it with his
</br>own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing
</br>attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
</br>hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
</br>practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.
</br>
</br>“Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish
</br>there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s
</br>dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
</br>his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.
</br>
</br>This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,
</br>and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a
</br>bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
</br>His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
</br>the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
</br>crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good
</br>eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on
</br>the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
</br>resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
</br>down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
</br>the man.
</br>
</br>Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
</br>came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with
</br>a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
</br>heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
</br>manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might
</br>have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
</br>in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being
</br>sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
</br>shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large
</br>earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick
</br>her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported
</br>by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but
</br>coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting
</br>of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
</br>line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
</br>shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
</br>he stepped over the way.
</br>
</br>The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
</br>rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
</br>a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
</br>dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
</br>of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the
</br>elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”
</br>
</br>“What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said Monsieur Defarge
</br>to himself; “I don’t know you.”
</br>
</br>But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
</br>with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.
</br>
</br>“How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is
</br>all the spilt wine swallowed?”
</br>
</br>“Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge.
</br>
</br>When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,
</br>picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,
</br>and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
</br>
</br>“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
</br>Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
</br>of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”
</br>
</br>“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.
</br>
</br>At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still
</br>using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of
</br>cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
</br>
</br>The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
</br>drinking vessel and smacked his lips.
</br>
</br>“Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
</br>always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I
</br>right, Jacques?”
</br>
</br>“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.
</br>
</br>This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment
</br>when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and
</br>slightly rustled in her seat.
</br>
</br>“Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen--my wife!”
</br>
</br>The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three
</br>flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
</br>giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the
</br>wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
</br>of spirit, and became absorbed in it.
</br>
</br>“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly
</br>upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you
</br>wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the
</br>fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
</br>close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of
</br>my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been
</br>there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”
</br>
</br>They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur
</br>Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
</br>gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.
</br>
</br>“Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
</br>the door.
</br>
</br>Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first
</br>word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had
</br>not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then
</br>beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge
</br>knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.
</br>
</br>Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
</br>joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
</br>company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
</br>and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
</br>by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
</br>gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee
</br>to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was
</br>a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable
</br>transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour
</br>in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,
</br>angry, dangerous man.
</br>
</br>“It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.”
</br> Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began
</br>ascending the stairs.
</br>
</br>“Is he alone?” the latter whispered.
</br>
</br>“Alone! God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the
</br>same low voice.
</br>
</br>“Is he always alone, then?”
</br>
</br>“Yes.”
</br>
</br>“Of his own desire?”
</br>
</br>“Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they
</br>found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be
</br>discreet--as he was then, so he is now.”
</br>
</br>“He is greatly changed?”
</br>
</br>“Changed!”
</br>
</br>The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,
</br>and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so
</br>forcible. Mr. Lorry’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his
</br>two companions ascended higher and higher.
</br>
</br>Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
</br>parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
</br>indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation
</br>within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,
</br>the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
</br>staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides
</br>flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and
</br>hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted
</br>the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
</br>intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost
</br>insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt
</br>and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to
</br>his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.
</br>Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made
</br>at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left
</br>uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
</br>to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were
</br>caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer
</br>or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any
</br>promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.
</br>
</br>At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
</br>third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
</br>and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
</br>was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in
</br>advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he
</br>dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about
</br>here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
</br>his shoulder, took out a key.
</br>
</br>“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.
</br>
</br>“Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.
</br>
</br>“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”
</br>
</br>“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it
</br>closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.
</br>
</br>“Why?”
</br>
</br>“Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be
</br>frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what
</br>harm--if his door was left open.”
</br>
</br>“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.
</br>
</br>“Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful
</br>world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things
</br>are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under
</br>that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”
</br>
</br>This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word
</br>of it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she trembled
</br>under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,
</br>and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent
</br>on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.
</br>
</br>“Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a
</br>moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,
</br>all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you
</br>bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.
</br>That’s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”
</br>
</br>They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were
</br>soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at
</br>once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at
</br>the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which
</br>the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing
</br>footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed
</br>themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
</br>wine-shop.
</br>
</br>“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur
</br>Defarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”
</br>
</br>The three glided by, and went silently down.
</br>
</br>There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
</br>the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
</br>Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:
</br>
</br>“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”
</br>
</br>“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”
</br>
</br>“Is that well?”
</br>
</br>“_I_ think it is well.”
</br>
</br>“Who are the few? How do you choose them?”
</br>
</br>“I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the
</br>sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another
</br>thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”
</br>
</br>With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in
</br>through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck
</br>twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to
</br>make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,
</br>three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned
</br>it as heavily as he could.
</br>
</br>The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the
</br>room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more
</br>than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.
</br>
</br>He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry
</br>got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for he
</br>felt that she was sinking.
</br>
</br>“A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of
</br>business shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”
</br>
</br>“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.
</br>
</br>“Of it? What?”
</br>
</br>“I mean of him. Of my father.”
</br>
</br>Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of
</br>their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
</br>shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her
</br>down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.
</br>
</br>Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
</br>took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,
</br>methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
</br>could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to
</br>where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.
</br>
</br>The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim
</br>and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the
</br>roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
</br>the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
</br>other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this
</br>door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.
</br>Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it
</br>was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
</br>alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
</br>requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being
</br>done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
</br>towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at
</br>him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very
</br>busy, making shoes.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>VI. The Shoemaker
</br>
</br>
</br>“Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that
</br>bent low over the shoemaking.
</br>
</br>It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
</br>salutation, as if it were at a distance:
</br>
</br>“Good day!”
</br>
</br>“You are still hard at work, I see?”
</br>
</br>After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the
</br>voice replied, “Yes--I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes
</br>had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.
</br>
</br>The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the
</br>faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
</br>doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
</br>the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo
</br>of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and
</br>resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
</br>beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and
</br>suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive
</br>it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,
</br>wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered
</br>home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
</br>
</br>Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked
</br>up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical
</br>perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were
</br>aware of had stood, was not yet empty.
</br>
</br>“I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,
</br>“to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?”
</br>
</br>The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,
</br>at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the
</br>other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.
</br>
</br>“What did you say?”
</br>
</br>“You can bear a little more light?”
</br>
</br>“I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a
</br>stress upon the second word.)
</br>
</br>The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that
</br>angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
</br>showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his
</br>labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
</br>feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very
</br>long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and
</br>thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet
</br>dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really
</br>otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
</br>His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body
</br>to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose
</br>stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion
</br>from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of
</br>parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.
</br>
</br>He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones
</br>of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
</br>pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without
</br>first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had
</br>lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without
</br>first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.
</br>
</br>“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,
</br>motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.
</br>
</br>“What did you say?”
</br>
</br>“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”
</br>
</br>“I can’t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don’t know.”
</br>
</br>But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When
</br>he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
</br>looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
</br>unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
</br>it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
</br>the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The
</br>look and the action had occupied but an instant.
</br>
</br>“You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge.
</br>
</br>“What did you say?”
</br>
</br>“Here is a visitor.”
</br>
</br>The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his
</br>work.
</br>
</br>“Come!” said Defarge. “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when
</br>he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.
</br>
</br>“Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”
</br>
</br>There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:
</br>
</br>“I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?”
</br>
</br>“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s
</br>information?”
</br>
</br>“It is a lady’s shoe. It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. It is in the
</br>present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.” He
</br>glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.
</br>
</br>“And the maker’s name?” said Defarge.
</br>
</br>Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand
</br>in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
</br>hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and
</br>so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission. The task of
</br>recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
</br>had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or
</br>endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a
</br>fast-dying man.
</br>
</br>“Did you ask me for my name?”
</br>
</br>“Assuredly I did.”
</br>
</br>“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”
</br>
</br>“Is that all?”
</br>
</br>“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”
</br>
</br>With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work
</br>again, until the silence was again broken.
</br>
</br>“You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly
</br>at him.
</br>
</br>His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the
</br>question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back
</br>on the questioner when they had sought the ground.
</br>
</br>“I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I
</br>learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--”
</br>
</br>He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his
</br>hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face
</br>from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and
</br>resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a
</br>subject of last night.
</br>
</br>“I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
</br>a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.”
</br>
</br>As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.
</br>Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:
</br>
</br>“Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?”
</br>
</br>The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the
</br>questioner.
</br>
</br>“Monsieur Manette”; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge’s arm; “do you
</br>remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old
</br>banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your
</br>mind, Monsieur Manette?”
</br>
</br>As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
</br>Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
</br>intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
</br>through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded
</br>again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And
</br>so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
</br>had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where
</br>she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only
</br>raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and
</br>shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,
</br>trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
</br>breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression
</br>repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it
</br>looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.
</br>
</br>Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and
</br>less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
</br>and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he
</br>took the shoe up, and resumed his work.
</br>
</br>“Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper.
</br>
</br>“Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
</br>unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
</br>well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!”
</br>
</br>She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
</br>which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
</br>figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
</br>over his labour.
</br>
</br>Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,
</br>beside him, and he bent over his work.
</br>
</br>It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument
</br>in his hand, for his shoemaker’s knife. It lay on that side of him
</br>which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was
</br>stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He
</br>raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,
</br>but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his
</br>striking at her with the knife, though they had.
</br>
</br>He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began
</br>to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in
</br>the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:
</br>
</br>“What is this?”
</br>
</br>With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her
</br>lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she
</br>laid his ruined head there.
</br>
</br>“You are not the gaoler’s daughter?”
</br>
</br>She sighed “No.”
</br>
</br>“Who are you?”
</br>
</br>Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
</br>beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange
</br>thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
</br>laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.
</br>
</br>Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed
</br>aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and
</br>little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action
</br>he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his
</br>shoemaking.
</br>
</br>But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his
</br>shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to
</br>be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand
</br>to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
</br>attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained
</br>a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden
</br>hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.
</br>
</br>He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. “It is
</br>the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!”
</br>
</br>As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to
</br>become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the
</br>light, and looked at her.
</br>
</br>“She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned
</br>out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was
</br>brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. ‘You will
</br>leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they
</br>may in the spirit.’ Those were the words I said. I remember them very
</br>well.”
</br>
</br>He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.
</br>But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,
</br>though slowly.
</br>
</br>“How was this?--_Was it you_?”
</br>
</br>Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a
</br>frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only
</br>said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
</br>us, do not speak, do not move!”
</br>
</br>“Hark!” he exclaimed. “Whose voice was that?”
</br>
</br>His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white
</br>hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his
</br>shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and
</br>tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and
</br>gloomily shook his head.
</br>
</br>“No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can’t be. See what the
</br>prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face
</br>she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He
</br>was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your
</br>name, my gentle angel?”
</br>
</br>Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees
</br>before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.
</br>
</br>“O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,
</br>and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I
</br>cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may
</br>tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless
</br>me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”
</br>
</br>His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and
</br>lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.
</br>
</br>“If you hear in my voice--I don’t know that it is so, but I hope it
</br>is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
</br>sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in
</br>touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
</br>breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when
</br>I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you
</br>with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the
</br>remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,
</br>weep for it, weep for it!”
</br>
</br>She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a
</br>child.
</br>
</br>“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
</br>have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
</br>peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
</br>and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And
</br>if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
</br>and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
</br>honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
</br>striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
</br>my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep
</br>for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred
</br>tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank
</br>God for us, thank God!”
</br>
</br>He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so
</br>touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
</br>had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.
</br>
</br>When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving
</br>breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
</br>storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm
</br>called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and
</br>daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay
</br>there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his
</br>head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained
</br>him from the light.
</br>
</br>“If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as
</br>he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could be
</br>arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he
</br>could be taken away--”
</br>
</br>“But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry.
</br>
</br>“More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
</br>him.”
</br>
</br>“It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. “More
</br>than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.
</br>Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”
</br>
</br>“That’s business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his
</br>methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”
</br>
</br>“Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here. You see how
</br>composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me
</br>now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from
</br>interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,
</br>as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until
</br>you return, and then we will remove him straight.”
</br>
</br>Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and
</br>in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage
</br>and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,
</br>for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
</br>dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
</br>to do it.
</br>
</br>Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the
</br>hard ground close at the father’s side, and watched him. The darkness
</br>deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed
</br>through the chinks in the wall.
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and
</br>had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and
</br>meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the
</br>lamp he carried, on the shoemaker’s bench (there was nothing else in the
</br>garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and
</br>assisted him to his feet.
</br>
</br>No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in
</br>the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,
</br>whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that
</br>he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They
</br>tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to
</br>answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for
</br>the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of
</br>occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen
</br>in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
</br>daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.
</br>
</br>In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he
</br>ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak
</br>and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to
</br>his daughter’s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand
</br>in both his own.
</br>
</br>They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.
</br>Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps
</br>of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and
</br>round at the walls.
</br>
</br>“You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?”
</br>
</br>“What did you say?”
</br>
</br>But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if
</br>she had repeated it.
</br>
</br>“Remember? No, I don’t remember. It was so very long ago.”
</br>
</br>That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
</br>prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,
</br>“One Hundred and Five, North Tower;” and when he looked about him, it
</br>evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed
</br>him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
</br>tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was
</br>no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he
</br>dropped his daughter’s hand and clasped his head again.
</br>
</br>No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the
</br>many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural
</br>silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and
</br>that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
</br>saw nothing.
</br>
</br>The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
</br>him, when Mr. Lorry’s feet were arrested on the step by his asking,
</br>miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame
</br>Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
</br>went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly
</br>brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned
</br>against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.
</br>
</br>Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The
</br>postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
</br>over-swinging lamps.
</br>
</br>Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better
</br>streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,
</br>illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
</br>gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. “Your papers,
</br>travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge,
</br>getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of
</br>monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with
</br>him, at the--” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the
</br>military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
</br>in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day
</br>or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. “It is well.
</br>Forward!” from the uniform. “Adieu!” from Defarge. And so, under a short
</br>grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great
</br>grove of stars.
</br>
</br>Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
</br>this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
</br>rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
</br>is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
</br>All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
</br>whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried
</br>man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
</br>lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:
</br>
</br>“I hope you care to be recalled to life?”
</br>
</br>And the old answer:
</br>
</br>“I can’t say.”

</br>
</br>
</br>I. Five Years Later
</br>
</br>
</br>Tellson’s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
</br>year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very
</br>dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,
</br>moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
</br>proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
</br>proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence
</br>in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if
</br>it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was
</br>no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
</br>convenient places of business. Tellson’s (they said) wanted
</br>no elbow-room, Tellson’s wanted no light, Tellson’s wanted no
</br>embellishment. Noakes and Co.’s might, or Snooks Brothers’ might; but
</br>Tellson’s, thank Heaven--!
</br>
</br>Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
</br>question of rebuilding Tellson’s. In this respect the House was much
</br>on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
</br>suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
</br>objectionable, but were only the more respectable.
</br>
</br>Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson’s was the triumphant perfection
</br>of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
</br>a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson’s down two steps,
</br>and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
</br>counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
</br>wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
</br>windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,
</br>and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
</br>heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing
</br>“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,
</br>where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its
</br>hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
</br>twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden
</br>drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
</br>they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they
</br>were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among
</br>the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good
</br>polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms
</br>made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their
</br>parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family
</br>papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
</br>dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year
</br>one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you
</br>by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released
</br>from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads
</br>exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
</br>Abyssinia or Ashantee.
</br>
</br>But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
</br>with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s.
</br>Death is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s?
</br>Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note
</br>was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the
</br>purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder
</br>of a horse at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to
</br>Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of
</br>three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to
</br>Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it
</br>might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
</br>reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each
</br>particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
</br>after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day, like greater places of business,
</br>its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid
</br>low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately
</br>disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the
</br>ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.
</br>
</br>Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson’s, the
</br>oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young
</br>man into Tellson’s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was
</br>old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full
</br>Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to
</br>be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches
</br>and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.
</br>
</br>Outside Tellson’s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an
</br>odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live
</br>sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless
</br>upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin
</br>of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson’s,
</br>in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always
</br>tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted
</br>this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful
</br>occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the
</br>easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
</br>appellation of Jerry.
</br>
</br>The scene was Mr. Cruncher’s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,
</br>Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March
</br>morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself
</br>always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under
</br>the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a
</br>popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher’s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were
</br>but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
</br>might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as
</br>it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was
</br>already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged
</br>for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth
</br>was spread.
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin
</br>at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll
</br>and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair
</br>looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he
</br>exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:
</br>
</br>“Bust me, if she ain’t at it agin!”
</br>
</br>A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
</br>corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
</br>person referred to.
</br>
</br>“What!” said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. “You’re at it
</br>agin, are you?”
</br>
</br>After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at
</br>the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the
</br>odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher’s domestic economy, that,
</br>whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he
</br>often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.
</br>
</br>“What,” said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his
</br>mark--“what are you up to, Aggerawayter?”
</br>
</br>“I was only saying my prayers.”
</br>
</br>“Saying your prayers! You’re a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping
</br>yourself down and praying agin me?”
</br>
</br>“I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.”
</br>
</br>“You weren’t. And if you were, I won’t be took the liberty with. Here!
</br>your mother’s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your
</br>father’s prosperity. You’ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
</br>You’ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
</br>herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out
</br>of the mouth of her only child.”
</br>
</br>Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning
</br>to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
</br>board.
</br>
</br>“And what do you suppose, you conceited female,” said Mr. Cruncher, with
</br>unconscious inconsistency, “that the worth of _your_ prayers may be?
</br>Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!”
</br>
</br>“They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than
</br>that.”
</br>
</br>“Worth no more than that,” repeated Mr. Cruncher. “They ain’t worth
</br>much, then. Whether or no, I won’t be prayed agin, I tell you. I can’t
</br>afford it. I’m not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If
</br>you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and
</br>child, and not in opposition to ‘em. If I had had any but a unnat’ral
</br>wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat’ral mother, I might
</br>have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
</br>countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.
</br>B-u-u-ust me!” said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting
</br>on his clothes, “if I ain’t, what with piety and one blowed thing and
</br>another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
</br>devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my
</br>boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
</br>then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I
</br>tell you,” here he addressed his wife once more, “I won’t be gone agin,
</br>in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I’m as sleepy as
</br>laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn’t know, if
</br>it wasn’t for the pain in ‘em, which was me and which somebody else, yet
</br>I’m none the better for it in pocket; and it’s my suspicion that you’ve
</br>been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
</br>it in pocket, and I won’t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you
</br>say now!”
</br>
</br>Growling, in addition, such phrases as “Ah! yes! You’re religious, too.
</br>You wouldn’t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
</br>and child, would you? Not you!” and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
</br>from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook
</br>himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.
</br>In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,
</br>and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father’s did,
</br>kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor
</br>woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made
</br>his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother.
</br>--Halloa, father!” and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in
</br>again with an undutiful grin.
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher’s temper was not at all improved when he came to his
</br>breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher’s saying grace with particular
</br>animosity.
</br>
</br>“Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?”
</br>
</br>His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”
</br>
</br>“Don’t do it!” said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected
</br>to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife’s petitions. “I
</br>ain’t a going to be blest out of house and home. I won’t have my wittles
</br>blest off my table. Keep still!”
</br>
</br>Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party
</br>which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried
</br>his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed
</br>inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o’clock he smoothed his ruffled
</br>aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as
</br>he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation
</br>of the day.
</br>
</br>It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite
</br>description of himself as “a honest tradesman.” His stock consisted of
</br>a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,
</br>young Jerry, walking at his father’s side, carried every morning to
</br>beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,
</br>with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
</br>from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man’s
</br>feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr.
</br>Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar
</br>itself,--and was almost as in-looking.
</br>
</br>Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his
</br>three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson’s,
</br>Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
</br>standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to
</br>inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
</br>boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,
</br>extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic
</br>in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two
</br>eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
</br>The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
</br>the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
</br>youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
</br>in Fleet-street.
</br>
</br>The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson’s
</br>establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:
</br>
</br>“Porter wanted!”
</br>
</br>“Hooray, father! Here’s an early job to begin with!”
</br>
</br>Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on
</br>the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
</br>had been chewing, and cogitated.
</br>
</br>“Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!” muttered young Jerry.
</br>“Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don’t get no iron
</br>rust here!”
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>II. A Sight
</br>
</br>
</br>“You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of
</br>clerks to Jerry the messenger.
</br>
</br>“Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. “I _do_
</br>know the Bailey.”
</br>
</br>“Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.”
</br>
</br>“I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much
</br>better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
</br>in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”
</br>
</br>“Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
</br>door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.”
</br>
</br>“Into the court, sir?”
</br>
</br>“Into the court.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to
</br>interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”
</br>
</br>“Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that
</br>conference.
</br>
</br>“I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
</br>Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry’s
</br>attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,
</br>to remain there until he wants you.”
</br>
</br>“Is that all, sir?”
</br>
</br>“That’s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him
</br>you are there.”
</br>
</br>As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
</br>Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the
</br>blotting-paper stage, remarked:
</br>
</br>“I suppose they’ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”
</br>
</br>“Treason!”
</br>
</br>“That’s quartering,” said Jerry. “Barbarous!”
</br>
</br>“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised
</br>spectacles upon him. “It is the law.”
</br>
</br>“It’s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It’s hard enough to kill
</br>him, but it’s wery hard to spile him, sir.”
</br>
</br>“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk. “Speak well of the law. Take
</br>care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
</br>care of itself. I give you that advice.”
</br>
</br>“It’s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry. “I
</br>leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”
</br>
</br>“Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of
</br>gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry
</br>ways. Here is the letter. Go along.”
</br>
</br>Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
</br>deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one,
</br>too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,
</br>and went his way.
</br>
</br>They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had
</br>not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
</br>But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
</br>villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
</br>into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
</br>dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It
</br>had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced
</br>his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died before him.
</br>For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,
</br>from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on
</br>a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a
</br>half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
</br>So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It
</br>was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted
</br>a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for
</br>the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and
</br>softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in
</br>blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
</br>leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
</br>under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
</br>illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism
</br>that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome
</br>consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.
</br>
</br>Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this
</br>hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
</br>way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in
</br>his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play
</br>at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the
</br>former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey
</br>doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the
</br>criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.
</br>
</br>After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
</br>very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into
</br>court.
</br>
</br>“What’s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next
</br>to.
</br>
</br>“Nothing yet.”
</br>
</br>“What’s coming on?”
</br>
</br>“The Treason case.”
</br>
</br>“The quartering one, eh?”
</br>
</br>“Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle to
</br>be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his own
</br>face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,
</br>and then his head will be chopped off, and he’ll be cut into quarters.
</br>That’s the sentence.”
</br>
</br>“If he’s found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of proviso.
</br>
</br>“Oh! they’ll find him guilty,” said the other. “Don’t you be afraid of
</br>that.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher’s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he
</br>saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry
</br>sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged
</br>gentleman, the prisoner’s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers
</br>before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
</br>in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him
</br>then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
</br>court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
</br>with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up
</br>to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
</br>
</br>“What’s _he_ got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken with.
</br>
</br>“Blest if I know,” said Jerry.
</br>
</br>“What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”
</br>
</br>“Blest if I know that either,” said Jerry.
</br>
</br>The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
</br>down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the
</br>central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
</br>went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.
</br>
</br>Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
</br>ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled
</br>at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round
</br>pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows
</br>stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,
</br>laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help
</br>themselves, at anybody’s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got
</br>upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.
</br>Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall
</br>of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
</br>whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with
</br>the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,
</br>that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him
</br>in an impure mist and rain.
</br>
</br>The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
</br>five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and
</br>a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly
</br>dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and
</br>dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out
</br>of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express
</br>itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his
</br>situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the
</br>soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,
</br>bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.
</br>
</br>The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,
</br>was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less
</br>horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage
</br>details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his
</br>fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
</br>was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
</br>and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various
</br>spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and
</br>powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.
</br>
</br>Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to
</br>an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that
</br>he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
</br>forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers
</br>occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
</br>King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and
</br>so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of
</br>our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
</br>said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
</br>evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
</br>said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation
</br>to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head
</br>becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with
</br>huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
</br>the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood
</br>there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and
</br>that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.
</br>
</br>The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,
</br>beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from
</br>the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and
</br>attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
</br>and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
</br>composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
</br>it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
</br>vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.
</br>
</br>Over the prisoner’s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
</br>upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
</br>it, and had passed from its surface and this earth’s together. Haunted
</br>in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the
</br>glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one
</br>day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
</br>for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner’s mind. Be
</br>that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
</br>of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his
</br>face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.
</br>
</br>It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court
</br>which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat,
</br>in that corner of the Judge’s bench, two persons upon whom his look
</br>immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his
</br>aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.
</br>
</br>The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than
</br>twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very
</br>remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,
</br>and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
</br>but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he
</br>looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as
</br>it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a
</br>handsome man, not past the prime of life.
</br>
</br>His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by
</br>him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her
</br>dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had
</br>been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
</br>that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very
</br>noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
</br>had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about,
</br>“Who are they?”
</br>
</br>Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own
</br>manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
</br>absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about
</br>him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
</br>from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
</br>to Jerry:
</br>
</br>“Witnesses.”
</br>
</br>“For which side?”
</br>
</br>“Against.”
</br>
</br>“Against what side?”
</br>
</br>“The prisoner’s.”
</br>
</br>The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,
</br>leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was
</br>in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the
</br>axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>III. A Disappointment
</br>
</br>
</br>Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
</br>them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
</br>claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the
</br>public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or
</br>even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the
</br>prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and
</br>repassing between France and England, on secret business of which
</br>he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of
</br>traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real
</br>wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.
</br>That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who
</br>was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the
</br>prisoner’s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his
</br>Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.
</br>That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and
</br>attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner’s
</br>friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
</br>infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
</br>in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues
</br>were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public
</br>benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as
</br>they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,
</br>as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well
</br>knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;
</br>whereat the jury’s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
</br>they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more
</br>especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
</br>That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
</br>for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had
</br>communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him
</br>a holy determination to examine his master’s table-drawers and pockets,
</br>and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to
</br>hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,
</br>in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General’s)
</br>brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.
</br>Attorney-General’s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence
</br>on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two
</br>witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
</br>produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
</br>his Majesty’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by
</br>sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
</br>such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be
</br>proved to be in the prisoner’s handwriting; but that it was all the
</br>same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as
</br>showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof
</br>would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged
</br>in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the
</br>very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.
</br>That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they
</br>were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must
</br>positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether
</br>they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their
</br>pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
</br>their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion
</br>of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that
</br>there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon
</br>pillows at all, unless the prisoner’s head was taken off. That head
</br>Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
</br>everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith
</br>of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
</br>good as dead and gone.
</br>
</br>When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
</br>a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in
</br>anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the
</br>unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.
</br>
</br>Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader’s lead, examined the
</br>patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was
</br>exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if
</br>it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom
</br>of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
</br>wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.
</br>Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting
</br>opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.
</br>
</br>Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation.
</br>What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn’t
</br>precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody’s.
</br>Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very
</br>distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors’
</br>prison? Didn’t see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors’
</br>prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three
</br>times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever
</br>been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?
</br>Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell
</br>downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at
</br>dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
</br>committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?
</br>Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not
</br>more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.
</br>Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a
</br>very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
</br>No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more
</br>about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.
</br>Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government
</br>pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear
</br>no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer
</br>patriotism? None whatever.
</br>
</br>The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a
</br>great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
</br>simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
</br>packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
</br>He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
</br>charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of
</br>the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging
</br>his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the
</br>prisoner’s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from
</br>the drawer of the prisoner’s desk. He had not put them there first. He
</br>had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
</br>at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
</br>Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given
</br>information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
</br>he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
</br>only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
</br>that was merely a coincidence. He didn’t call it a particularly curious
</br>coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a
</br>curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He
</br>was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.
</br>
</br>The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis
</br>Lorry.
</br>
</br>“Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson’s bank?”
</br>
</br>“I am.”
</br>
</br>“On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and
</br>seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and
</br>Dover by the mail?”
</br>
</br>“It did.”
</br>
</br>“Were there any other passengers in the mail?”
</br>
</br>“Two.”
</br>
</br>“Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?”
</br>
</br>“They did.”
</br>
</br>“Mr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?”
</br>
</br>“I cannot undertake to say that he was.”
</br>
</br>“Does he resemble either of these two passengers?”
</br>
</br>“Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so
</br>reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.”
</br>
</br>“Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as
</br>those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to
</br>render it unlikely that he was one of them?”
</br>
</br>“No.”
</br>
</br>“You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?”
</br>
</br>“No.”
</br>
</br>“So at least you say he may have been one of them?”
</br>
</br>“Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like
</br>myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous
</br>air.”
</br>
</br>“Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?”
</br>
</br>“I certainly have seen that.”
</br>
</br>“Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your
</br>certain knowledge, before?”
</br>
</br>“I have.”
</br>
</br>“When?”
</br>
</br>“I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the
</br>prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the
</br>voyage with me.”
</br>
</br>“At what hour did he come on board?”
</br>
</br>“At a little after midnight.”
</br>
</br>“In the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board
</br>at that untimely hour?”
</br>
</br>“He happened to be the only one.”
</br>
</br>“Never mind about ‘happening,’ Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who
</br>came on board in the dead of the night?”
</br>
</br>“He was.”
</br>
</br>“Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?”
</br>
</br>“With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.”
</br>
</br>“They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?”
</br>
</br>“Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and
</br>I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.”
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette!”
</br>
</br>The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now
</br>turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and
</br>kept her hand drawn through his arm.
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.”
</br>
</br>To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was
</br>far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
</br>Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all
</br>the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him
</br>to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
</br>before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts
</br>to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
</br>rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?”
</br>
</br>“Yes, sir.”
</br>
</br>“Where?”
</br>
</br>“On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same
</br>occasion.”
</br>
</br>“You are the young lady just now referred to?”
</br>
</br>“O! most unhappily, I am!”
</br>
</br>The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
</br>of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: “Answer the questions put
</br>to you, and make no remark upon them.”
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
</br>passage across the Channel?”
</br>
</br>“Yes, sir.”
</br>
</br>“Recall it.”
</br>
</br>In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: “When the
</br>gentleman came on board--”
</br>
</br>“Do you mean the prisoner?” inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.
</br>
</br>“Yes, my Lord.”
</br>
</br>“Then say the prisoner.”
</br>
</br>“When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning
</br>her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued
</br>and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was
</br>afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
</br>deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take
</br>care of him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four.
</br>The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could
</br>shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I
</br>had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would
</br>set when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed
</br>great gentleness and kindness for my father’s state, and I am sure he
</br>felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.”
</br>
</br>“Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?”
</br>
</br>“No.”
</br>
</br>“How many were with him?”
</br>
</br>“Two French gentlemen.”
</br>
</br>“Had they conferred together?”
</br>
</br>“They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
</br>necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.”
</br>
</br>“Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?”
</br>
</br>“Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don’t know what
</br>papers.”
</br>
</br>“Like these in shape and size?”
</br>
</br>“Possibly, but indeed I don’t know, although they stood whispering very
</br>near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
</br>light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they
</br>spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that
</br>they looked at papers.”
</br>
</br>“Now, to the prisoner’s conversation, Miss Manette.”
</br>
</br>“The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out
</br>of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my
</br>father. I hope,” bursting into tears, “I may not repay him by doing him
</br>harm to-day.”
</br>
</br>Buzzing from the blue-flies.
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
</br>you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must
</br>give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,
</br>he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.”
</br>
</br>“He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
</br>difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was
</br>therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business
</br>had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,
</br>take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long
</br>time to come.”
</br>
</br>“Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.”
</br>
</br>“He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said
</br>that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on
</br>England’s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
</br>Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
</br>Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
</br>laughingly, and to beguile the time.”
</br>
</br>Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
</br>a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
</br>unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully
</br>anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
</br>she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
</br>the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same
</br>expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
</br>of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
</br>when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
</br>heresy about George Washington.
</br>
</br>Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it
</br>necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady’s
</br>father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.
</br>
</br>“Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?”
</br>
</br>“Once. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or
</br>three years and a half ago.”
</br>
</br>“Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or
</br>speak to his conversation with your daughter?”
</br>
</br>“Sir, I can do neither.”
</br>
</br>“Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
</br>either?”
</br>
</br>He answered, in a low voice, “There is.”
</br>
</br>“Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without
</br>trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?”
</br>
</br>He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.”
</br>
</br>“Were you newly released on the occasion in question?”
</br>
</br>“They tell me so.”
</br>
</br>“Have you no remembrance of the occasion?”
</br>
</br>“None. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what
</br>time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the
</br>time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
</br>here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
</br>my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become
</br>familiar. I have no remembrance of the process.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down
</br>together.
</br>
</br>A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being
</br>to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,
</br>in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and
</br>got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did
</br>not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more,
</br>to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness
</br>was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required,
</br>in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,
</br>waiting for another person. The prisoner’s counsel was cross-examining
</br>this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner
</br>on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
</br>been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a
</br>little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening
</br>this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
</br>attention and curiosity at the prisoner.
</br>
</br>“You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?”
</br>
</br>The witness was quite sure.
</br>
</br>“Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?”
</br>
</br>Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.
</br>
</br>“Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,” pointing
</br>to him who had tossed the paper over, “and then look well upon the
</br>prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?”
</br>
</br>Allowing for my learned friend’s appearance being careless and slovenly
</br>if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
</br>not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
</br>into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
</br>his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
</br>much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner’s
</br>counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned
</br>friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he
</br>would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might
</br>happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
</br>this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so
</br>confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash
</br>this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to
</br>useless lumber.
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
</br>fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr.
</br>Stryver fitted the prisoner’s case on the jury, like a compact suit
</br>of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and
</br>traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
</br>scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look
</br>rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,
</br>and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
</br>swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family
</br>affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making
</br>those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a
</br>consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,
</br>even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped
</br>and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they
</br>had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
</br>gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
</br>and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that
</br>reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
</br>impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
</br>How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
</br>attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
</br>and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;
</br>how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous
</br>character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the
</br>State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed
</br>(with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could
</br>not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.
</br>
</br>Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to
</br>attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.
</br>Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
</br>Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
</br>prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
</br>the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole
</br>decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.
</br>
</br>And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.
</br>
</br>Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
</br>changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.
</br>While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him,
</br>whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced
</br>anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
</br>grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,
</br>and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
</br>in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man
</br>sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put
</br>on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his
</br>hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
</br>day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him
</br>a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he
</br>undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,
</br>when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the
</br>lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would
</br>hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the
</br>observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea
</br>that _he_ don’t get no law-work to do. Don’t look like the sort of one
</br>to get any, do he?”
</br>
</br>Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
</br>appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette’s head dropped upon
</br>her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:
</br>“Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out.
</br>Don’t you see she will fall!”
</br>
</br>There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much
</br>sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to
</br>him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown
</br>strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or
</br>brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,
</br>ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a
</br>moment, spoke, through their foreman.
</br>
</br>They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George
</br>Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,
</br>but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,
</br>and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in
</br>the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the
</br>jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get
</br>refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat
</br>down.
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out,
</br>now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,
</br>could easily get near him.
</br>
</br>“Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the
</br>way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don’t be a moment
</br>behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You
</br>are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long
</br>before I can.”
</br>
</br>Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in
</br>acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up
</br>at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.
</br>
</br>“How is the young lady?”
</br>
</br>“She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she
</br>feels the better for being out of court.”
</br>
</br>“I’ll tell the prisoner so. It won’t do for a respectable bank gentleman
</br>like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
</br>in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.
</br>The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all
</br>eyes, ears, and spikes.
</br>
</br>“Mr. Darnay!”
</br>
</br>The prisoner came forward directly.
</br>
</br>“You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She
</br>will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.”
</br>
</br>“I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so
</br>for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?”
</br>
</br>“Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Carton’s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood,
</br>half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.
</br>
</br>“I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.”
</br>
</br>“What,” said Carton, still only half turned towards him, “do you expect,
</br>Mr. Darnay?”
</br>
</br>“The worst.”
</br>
</br>“It’s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their
</br>withdrawing is in your favour.”
</br>
</br>Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
</br>more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
</br>in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above
</br>them.
</br>
</br>An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded
</br>passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.
</br>The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
</br>refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
</br>of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along
</br>with them.
</br>
</br>“Jerry! Jerry!” Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got
</br>there.
</br>
</br>“Here, sir! It’s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. “Quick! Have you got
</br>it?”
</br>
</br>“Yes, sir.”
</br>
</br>Hastily written on the paper was the word “ACQUITTED.”
</br>
</br>“If you had sent the message, ‘Recalled to Life,’ again,” muttered
</br>Jerry, as he turned, “I should have known what you meant, this time.”
</br>
</br>He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,
</br>until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
</br>with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
</br>swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in
</br>search of other carrion.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>IV. Congratulatory
</br>
</br>
</br>From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
</br>human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
</br>Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
</br>for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
</br>Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
</br>death.
</br>
</br>It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
</br>in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
</br>shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him
</br>twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
</br>had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and
</br>to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent
</br>reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long
</br>lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition
</br>from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of
</br>itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those
</br>unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
</br>Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three
</br>hundred miles away.
</br>
</br>Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
</br>his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his
</br>misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,
</br>the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial
</br>influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could
</br>recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few
</br>and slight, and she believed them over.
</br>
</br>Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned
</br>to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little
</br>more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
</br>loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
</br>way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
</br>conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.
</br>
</br>He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his
</br>late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean
</br>out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.
</br>Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the
</br>less likely to succeed on that account.”
</br>
</br>“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”
</br> said his late client, taking his hand.
</br>
</br>“I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as
</br>another man’s, I believe.”
</br>
</br>It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry
</br>said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
</br>object of squeezing himself back again.
</br>
</br>“You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. “Well! you have been present all day,
</br>and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.”
</br>
</br>“And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
</br>now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered
</br>him out of it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up
</br>this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.
</br>Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”
</br>
</br>“Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver; “I have a night’s work to
</br>do yet. Speak for yourself.”
</br>
</br>“I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and for
</br>Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?”
</br> He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.
</br>
</br>His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
</br>Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
</br>not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his
</br>thoughts had wandered away.
</br>
</br>“My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.
</br>
</br>He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.
</br>
</br>“Shall we go home, my father?”
</br>
</br>With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”
</br>
</br>The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
</br>impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be
</br>released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the
</br>passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,
</br>and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of
</br>gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
</br>Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into
</br>the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
</br>departed in it.
</br>
</br>Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
</br>to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or
</br>interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
</br>against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
</br>out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now
</br>stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.
</br>
</br>“So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”
</br>
</br>Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton’s part in the day’s
</br>proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the
</br>better for it in appearance.
</br>
</br>“If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
</br>business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
</br>appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before,
</br>sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We
</br>have to think of the House more than ourselves.”
</br>
</br>“_I_ know, _I_ know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. “Don’t be
</br>nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,
</br>I dare say.”
</br>
</br>“And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really don’t
</br>know what you have to do with the matter. If you’ll excuse me, as very
</br>much your elder, for saying so, I really don’t know that it is your
</br>business.”
</br>
</br>“Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business,” said Mr. Carton.
</br>
</br>“It is a pity you have not, sir.”
</br>
</br>“I think so, too.”
</br>
</br>“If you had,” pursued Mr. Lorry, “perhaps you would attend to it.”
</br>
</br>“Lord love you, no!--I shouldn’t,” said Mr. Carton.
</br>
</br>“Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,
</br>“business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,
</br>if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
</br>Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
</br>for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!
</br>I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
</br>life.--Chair there!”
</br>
</br>Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
</br>Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson’s. Carton,
</br>who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
</br>then, and turned to Darnay:
</br>
</br>“This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must
</br>be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
</br>these street stones?”
</br>
</br>“I hardly seem yet,” returned Charles Darnay, “to belong to this world
</br>again.”
</br>
</br>“I don’t wonder at it; it’s not so long since you were pretty far
</br>advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.”
</br>
</br>“I begin to think I _am_ faint.”
</br>
</br>“Then why the devil don’t you dine? I dined, myself, while those
</br>numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or
</br>some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”
</br>
</br>Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to
</br>Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were
</br>shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
</br>his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
</br>opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port
</br>before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.
</br>
</br>“Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.
</br>Darnay?”
</br>
</br>“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
</br>mended as to feel that.”
</br>
</br>“It must be an immense satisfaction!”
</br>
</br>He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large
</br>one.
</br>
</br>“As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
</br>It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we
</br>are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are
</br>not much alike in any particular, you and I.”
</br>
</br>Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
</br>this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was
</br>at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.
</br>
</br>“Now your dinner is done,” Carton presently said, “why don’t you call a
</br>health, Mr. Darnay; why don’t you give your toast?”
</br>
</br>“What health? What toast?”
</br>
</br>“Why, it’s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I’ll
</br>swear it’s there.”
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette, then!”
</br>
</br>“Miss Manette, then!”
</br>
</br>Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton
</br>flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to
</br>pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.
</br>
</br>“That’s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!”
</br> he said, filling his new goblet.
</br>
</br>A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer.
</br>
</br>“That’s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it
</br>feel? Is it worth being tried for one’s life, to be the object of such
</br>sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”
</br>
</br>Again Darnay answered not a word.
</br>
</br>“She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not
</br>that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”
</br>
</br>The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this
</br>disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the
</br>strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him
</br>for it.
</br>
</br>“I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder.
</br>“It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don’t know why I did
</br>it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.”
</br>
</br>“Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”
</br>
</br>“Do you think I particularly like you?”
</br>
</br>“Really, Mr. Carton,” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I have
</br>not asked myself the question.”
</br>
</br>“But ask yourself the question now.”
</br>
</br>“You have acted as if you do; but I don’t think you do.”
</br>
</br>“_I_ don’t think I do,” said Carton. “I begin to have a very good
</br>opinion of your understanding.”
</br>
</br>“Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is
</br>nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
</br>parting without ill-blood on either side.”
</br>
</br>Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang. “Do you call the whole
</br>reckoning?” said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, “Then
</br>bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at
</br>ten.”
</br>
</br>The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.
</br>Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
</br>of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
</br>I am drunk?”
</br>
</br>“I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.”
</br>
</br>“Think? You know I have been drinking.”
</br>
</br>“Since I must say so, I know it.”
</br>
</br>“Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I
</br>care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”
</br>
</br>“Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.”
</br>
</br>“May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don’t let your sober face elate you,
</br>however; you don’t know what it may come to. Good night!”
</br>
</br>When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a
</br>glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.
</br>
</br>“Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image; “why
</br>should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing
</br>in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have
</br>made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you
</br>what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change
</br>places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
</br>he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and
</br>have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.”
</br>
</br>He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
</br>minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the
</br>table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>V. The Jackal
</br>
</br>
</br>Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is
</br>the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate
</br>statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
</br>in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a
</br>perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
</br>The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
</br>learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.
</br>Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
</br>practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the
</br>drier parts of the legal race.
</br>
</br>A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had
</br>begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
</br>he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,
</br>specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the
</br>visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King’s Bench, the
</br>florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of
</br>the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
</br>among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.
</br>
</br>It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
</br>man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that
</br>faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
</br>among the most striking and necessary of the advocate’s accomplishments.
</br>But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more
</br>business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
</br>pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
</br>Carton, he always had his points at his fingers’ ends in the morning.
</br>
</br>Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver’s great
</br>ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,
</br>might have floated a king’s ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,
</br>anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
</br>at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there
</br>they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was
</br>rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
</br>to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,
</br>among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton
</br>would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he
</br>rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.
</br>
</br>“Ten o’clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to
</br>wake him--“ten o’clock, sir.”
</br>
</br>“_What’s_ the matter?”
</br>
</br>“Ten o’clock, sir.”
</br>
</br>“What do you mean? Ten o’clock at night?”
</br>
</br>“Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.”
</br>
</br>“Oh! I remember. Very well, very well.”
</br>
</br>After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man
</br>dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,
</br>he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,
</br>and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King’s
</br>Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.
</br>
</br>The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
</br>home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on,
</br>and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He
</br>had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
</br>may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of
</br>Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of
</br>Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.
</br>
</br>“You are a little late, Memory,” said Stryver.
</br>
</br>“About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.”
</br>
</br>They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,
</br>where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in
</br>the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon
</br>it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.
</br>
</br>“You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.”
</br>
</br>“Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day’s client; or
</br>seeing him dine--it’s all one!”
</br>
</br>“That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
</br>identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?”
</br>
</br>“I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have
</br>been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.
</br>
</br>“You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.”
</br>
</br>Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining
</br>room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel
</br>or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them
</br>out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down
</br>at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”
</br>
</br>“Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,” said Mr. Stryver,
</br>gaily, as he looked among his papers.
</br>
</br>“How much?”
</br>
</br>“Only two sets of them.”
</br>
</br>“Give me the worst first.”
</br>
</br>“There they are, Sydney. Fire away!”
</br>
</br>The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
</br>drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
</br>proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to
</br>his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in
</br>a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
</br>his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some
</br>lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,
</br>so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
</br>stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or
</br>more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the
</br>matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on
</br>him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the
</br>jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
</br>no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
</br>gravity.
</br>
</br>At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
</br>proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,
</br>made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
</br>assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
</br>hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then
</br>invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application
</br>to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
</br>this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
</br>disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.
</br>
</br>“And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr.
</br>Stryver.
</br>
</br>The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming
</br>again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.
</br>
</br>“You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
</br>to-day. Every question told.”
</br>
</br>“I always am sound; am I not?”
</br>
</br>“I don’t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to
</br>it and smooth it again.”
</br>
</br>With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.
</br>
</br>“The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding
</br>his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the
</br>old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
</br>now in despondency!”
</br>
</br>“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the same
</br>luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”
</br>
</br>“And why not?”
</br>
</br>“God knows. It was my way, I suppose.”
</br>
</br>He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
</br>him, looking at the fire.
</br>
</br>“Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
</br>as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
</br>was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney
</br>Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way
</br>is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look
</br>at me.”
</br>
</br>“Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more
</br>good-humoured laugh, “don’t _you_ be moral!”
</br>
</br>“How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do what I
</br>do?”
</br>
</br>“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it’s not worth
</br>your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to
</br>do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”
</br>
</br>“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”
</br>
</br>“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said
</br>Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.
</br>
</br>“Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”
</br> pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
</br>mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,
</br>picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we
</br>didn’t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always
</br>nowhere.”
</br>
</br>“And whose fault was that?”
</br>
</br>“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
</br>driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
</br>that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It’s a gloomy
</br>thing, however, to talk about one’s own past, with the day breaking.
</br>Turn me in some other direction before I go.”
</br>
</br>“Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding up
</br>his glass. “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”
</br>
</br>Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.
</br>
</br>“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. “I have had
</br>enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who’s your pretty witness?”
</br>
</br>“The picturesque doctor’s daughter, Miss Manette.”
</br>
</br>“_She_ pretty?”
</br>
</br>“Is she not?”
</br>
</br>“No.”
</br>
</br>“Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!”
</br>
</br>“Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge
</br>of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!”
</br>
</br>“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,
</br>and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather
</br>thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
</br>and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”
</br>
</br>“Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a
</br>yard or two of a man’s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.
</br>I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I’ll have no more drink;
</br>I’ll get to bed.”
</br>
</br>When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light
</br>him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
</br>windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the
</br>dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a
</br>lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
</br>before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
</br>the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.
</br>
</br>Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still
</br>on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the
</br>wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
</br>perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
</br>from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
</br>fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
</br>A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
</br>houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
</br>pillow was wet with wasted tears.
</br>
</br>Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
</br>good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
</br>incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
</br>on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>VI. Hundreds of People
</br>
</br>
</br>The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
</br>far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the
</br>waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
</br>it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
</br>Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
</br>on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into
</br>business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor’s friend, and the
</br>quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.
</br>
</br>On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
</br>the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
</br>Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
</br>secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with
</br>them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
</br>generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have
</br>his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
</br>Doctor’s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
</br>them.
</br>
</br>A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be
</br>found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of
</br>the Doctor’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
</br>had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,
</br>north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers
</br>grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a
</br>consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,
</br>instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
</br>settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which
</br>the peaches ripened in their season.
</br>
</br>The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
</br>of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
</br>though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
</br>glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
</br>place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
</br>
</br>There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
</br>there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
</br>several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
</br>audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
</br>a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
</br>rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
</br>to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
</br>who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if
</br>he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all
</br>visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
</br>to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
</br>a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
</br>workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
</br>about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
</br>thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
</br>required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
</br>the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
</br>from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.
</br>
</br>Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
</br>its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
</br>His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
</br>ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
</br>he earned as much as he wanted.
</br>
</br>These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry’s knowledge, thoughts, and
</br>notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
</br>on the fine Sunday afternoon.
</br>
</br>“Doctor Manette at home?”
</br>
</br>Expected home.
</br>
</br>“Miss Lucie at home?”
</br>
</br>Expected home.
</br>
</br>“Miss Pross at home?”
</br>
</br>Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
</br>anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the
</br>fact.
</br>
</br>“As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I’ll go upstairs.”
</br>
</br>Although the Doctor’s daughter had known nothing of the country of her
</br>birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
</br>make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
</br>agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off
</br>by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,
</br>that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the
</br>rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,
</br>the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
</br>delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in
</br>themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry
</br>stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,
</br>with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
</br>time, whether he approved?
</br>
</br>There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
</br>communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
</br>all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
</br>he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was
</br>the best room, and in it were Lucie’s birds, and flowers, and books,
</br>and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
</br>the Doctor’s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
</br>changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
</br>Doctor’s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker’s
</br>bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
</br>dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.
</br>
</br>“I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps
</br>that reminder of his sufferings about him!”
</br>
</br>“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.
</br>
</br>It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
</br>acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and
</br>had since improved.
</br>
</br>“I should have thought--” Mr. Lorry began.
</br>
</br>“Pooh! You’d have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.
</br>
</br>“How do you do?” inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
</br>express that she bore him no malice.
</br>
</br>“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how
</br>are you?”
</br>
</br>“Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.
</br>
</br>“Indeed?”
</br>
</br>“Ah! indeed!” said Miss Pross. “I am very much put out about my
</br>Ladybird.”
</br>
</br>“Indeed?”
</br>
</br>“For gracious sake say something else besides ‘indeed,’ or you’ll
</br>fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
</br>stature) was shortness.
</br>
</br>“Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.
</br>
</br>“Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. Yes, I am
</br>very much put out.”
</br>
</br>“May I ask the cause?”
</br>
</br>“I don’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to
</br>come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross.
</br>
</br>“_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”
</br>
</br>“Hundreds,” said Miss Pross.
</br>
</br>It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
</br>time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
</br>she exaggerated it.
</br>
</br>“Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.
</br>
</br>“I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
</br>paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take
</br>your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
</br>for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it’s really very hard,”
</br> said Miss Pross.
</br>
</br>Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;
</br>using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
</br>fit anything.
</br>
</br>“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
</br>are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it--”
</br>
</br>“_I_ began it, Miss Pross?”
</br>
</br>“Didn’t you? Who brought her father to life?”
</br>
</br>“Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--” said Mr. Lorry.
</br>
</br>“It wasn’t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
</br>enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
</br>that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
</br>him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
</br>circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
</br>and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
</br>him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
</br>this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
</br>unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
</br>admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
</br>it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
</br>never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
</br>their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there
</br>is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
</br>rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
</br>respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
</br>mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss
</br>Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
</br>better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson’s.
</br>
</br>“There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,” said
</br>Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn’t made a
</br>mistake in life.”
</br>
</br>Here again: Mr. Lorry’s inquiries into Miss Pross’s personal history had
</br>established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel
</br>who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to
</br>speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with
</br>no touch of compunction. Miss Pross’s fidelity of belief in Solomon
</br>(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious
</br>matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.
</br>
</br>“As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
</br>business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
</br>sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you--does the Doctor,
</br>in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”
</br>
</br>“Never.”
</br>
</br>“And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”
</br>
</br>“Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. “But I don’t say he don’t
</br>refer to it within himself.”
</br>
</br>“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”
</br>
</br>“I do,” said Miss Pross.
</br>
</br>“Do you imagine--” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up
</br>short with:
</br>
</br>“Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.”
</br>
</br>“I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
</br>sometimes?”
</br>
</br>“Now and then,” said Miss Pross.
</br>
</br>“Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his
</br>bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any
</br>theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
</br>the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
</br>oppressor?”
</br>
</br>“I don’t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”
</br>
</br>“And that is--?”
</br>
</br>“That she thinks he has.”
</br>
</br>“Now don’t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a
</br>mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”
</br>
</br>“Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.
</br>
</br>Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No, no,
</br>no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor
</br>Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
</br>he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,
</br>though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
</br>intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
</br>attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss
</br>Pross, I don’t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
</br>zealous interest.”
</br>
</br>“Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll tell
</br>me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid
</br>of the whole subject.”
</br>
</br>“Afraid?”
</br>
</br>“It’s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It’s a dreadful
</br>remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not
</br>knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
</br>feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn’t make the
</br>subject pleasant, I should think.”
</br>
</br>It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. “True,” said
</br>he, “and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss
</br>Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression
</br>always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
</br>it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”
</br>
</br>“Can’t be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. “Touch that
</br>string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.
</br>In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in
</br>the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
</br>up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to
</br>know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in
</br>his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up
</br>and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says
</br>a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it
</br>best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down
</br>together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
</br>brought him to himself.”
</br>
</br>Notwithstanding Miss Pross’s denial of her own imagination, there was a
</br>perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
</br>in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
</br>her possessing such a thing.
</br>
</br>The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
</br>had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
</br>seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
</br>set it going.
</br>
</br>“Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
</br>“and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”
</br>
</br>It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
</br>peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,
</br>looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied
</br>they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
</br>the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
</br>heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
</br>at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross
</br>was ready at the street door to receive them.
</br>
</br>Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
</br>off her darling’s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
</br>with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
</br>folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with
</br>as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
</br>had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant
</br>sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
</br>her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do
</br>playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
</br>chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
</br>them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
</br>eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
</br>have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
</br>beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
</br>stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no
</br>Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain
</br>for the fulfilment of Miss Pross’s prediction.
</br>
</br>Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of
</br>the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
</br>always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
</br>quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
</br>contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
</br>better. Miss Pross’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical
</br>kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
</br>impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
</br>impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters
</br>of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
</br>who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,
</br>or Cinderella’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
</br>a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
</br>pleased.
</br>
</br>On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor’s table, but on other days
</br>persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
</br>regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
</br>which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,
</br>Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird’s pleasant face and pleasant efforts
</br>to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.
</br>
</br>It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
</br>wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
</br>there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
</br>they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
</br>the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some
</br>time before, as Mr. Lorry’s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
</br>plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs
</br>and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
</br>whispered to them in its own way above their heads.
</br>
</br>Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
</br>presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
</br>was only One.
</br>
</br>Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross
</br>suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
</br>retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this
</br>disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the
</br>jerks.”
</br>
</br>The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The
</br>resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as
</br>they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
</br>his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
</br>likeness.
</br>
</br>He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
</br>vivacity. “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the
</br>plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
</br>which happened to be the old buildings of London--“have you seen much of
</br>the Tower?”
</br>
</br>“Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of
</br>it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”
</br>
</br>“_I_ have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile,
</br>though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a
</br>character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
</br>curious thing when I was there.”
</br>
</br>“What was that?” Lucie asked.
</br>
</br>“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
</br>had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of
</br>its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
</br>prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone
</br>in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
</br>execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with
</br>some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.
</br>At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
</br>examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or
</br>legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
</br>were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested
</br>that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The
</br>floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
</br>earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
</br>the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
</br>or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he
</br>had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”
</br>
</br>“My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”
</br>
</br>He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and
</br>his look quite terrified them all.
</br>
</br>“No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
</br>made me start. We had better go in.”
</br>
</br>He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large
</br>drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he
</br>said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
</br>of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
</br>either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned
</br>towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
</br>when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.
</br>
</br>He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of
</br>his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
</br>steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
</br>was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
</br>that the rain had startled him.
</br>
</br>Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon
</br>her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he
</br>made only Two.
</br>
</br>The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
</br>windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was
</br>done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
</br>heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton
</br>leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of
</br>the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the
</br>ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.
</br>
</br>“The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor
</br>Manette. “It comes slowly.”
</br>
</br>“It comes surely,” said Carton.
</br>
</br>They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a
</br>dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.
</br>
</br>There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
</br>get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes
</br>resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a
</br>footstep was there.
</br>
</br>“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had
</br>listened for a while.
</br>
</br>“Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. “Sometimes, I have
</br>sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of
</br>a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
</br>solemn--”
</br>
</br>“Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.”
</br>
</br>“It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we
</br>originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
</br>sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made
</br>the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
</br>by-and-bye into our lives.”
</br>
</br>“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”
</br> Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.
</br>
</br>The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
</br>rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
</br>as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
</br>coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
</br>the distant streets, and not one within sight.
</br>
</br>“Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or
</br>are we to divide them among us?”
</br>
</br>“I don’t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
</br>asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
</br>then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
</br>into my life, and my father’s.”
</br>
</br>“I take them into mine!” said Carton. “_I_ ask no questions and make no
</br>stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,
</br>and I see them--by the Lightning.” He added the last words, after there
</br>had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.
</br>
</br>“And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. “Here they
</br>come, fast, fierce, and furious!”
</br>
</br>It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
</br>for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
</br>lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment’s
</br>interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at
</br>midnight.
</br>
</br>The great bell of Saint Paul’s was striking one in the cleared air, when
</br>Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set
</br>forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches
</br>of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
</br>of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was
</br>usually performed a good two hours earlier.
</br>
</br>“What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry, “to
</br>bring the dead out of their graves.”
</br>
</br>“I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don’t expect to--what
</br>would do that,” answered Jerry.
</br>
</br>“Good night, Mr. Carton,” said the man of business. “Good night, Mr.
</br>Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”
</br>
</br>Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,
</br>bearing down upon them, too.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>VII. Monseigneur in Town
</br>
</br>
</br>Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
</br>fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
</br>his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
</br>the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
</br>was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many
</br>things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
</br>rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could not so
</br>much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
</br>strong men besides the Cook.
</br>
</br>Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
</br>Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
</br>pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
</br>conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur’s lips. One lacquey carried
</br>the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed
</br>the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;
</br>a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold
</br>watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to
</br>dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
</br>place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon
</br>his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
</br>men; he must have died of two.
</br>
</br>Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy
</br>and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at
</br>a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so
</br>impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far
</br>more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
</br>state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance
</br>for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly
</br>favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted
</br>days of the merry Stuart who sold it.
</br>
</br>Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which
</br>was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
</br>business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
</br>his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and
</br>particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world
</br>was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original
</br>by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness
</br>thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”
</br>
</br>Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
</br>his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of
</br>affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances
</br>public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and
</br>must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances
</br>private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after
</br>generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
</br>Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
</br>time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
</br>wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
</br>poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with
</br>a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer
</br>rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior
</br>mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked
</br>down upon him with the loftiest contempt.
</br>
</br>A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his
</br>stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
</br>waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
</br>forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial
</br>relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality
</br>among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.
</br>
</br>For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with
</br>every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
</br>achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any
</br>reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
</br>so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
</br>equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
</br>have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have
</br>been anybody’s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers
</br>destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;
</br>civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the
</br>worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;
</br>all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in
</br>pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
</br>Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
</br>anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the
</br>score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,
</br>yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives
</br>passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were
</br>no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
</br>for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly
</br>patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had
</br>discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
</br>State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
</br>root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
</br>they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
</br>Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
</br>card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
</br>Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this
</br>wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
</br>the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been
</br>since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
</br>subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of
</br>exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various
</br>notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
</br>among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half
</br>of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among
</br>the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and
</br>appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of
</br>bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far
</br>towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing
</br>known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,
</br>and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
</br>supped as at twenty.
</br>
</br>The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
</br>upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
</br>people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
</br>things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting
</br>them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
</br>sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
</br>whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
</br>spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
</br>Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
</br>three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
</br>jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the
</br>Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
</br>out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of
</br>the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
</br>by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
</br>discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
</br>became manifest.
</br>
</br>But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
</br>Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been
</br>ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally
</br>correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such
</br>delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant
</br>swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would
</br>surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen
</br>of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
</br>languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
</br>and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
</br>fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
</br>his devouring hunger far away.
</br>
</br>Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
</br>things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
</br>was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through
</br>Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals
</br>of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball
</br>descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was
</br>required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,
</br>and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a
</br>rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
</br>Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call
</br>him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at
</br>Monseigneur’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
</br>of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled
</br>hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would
</br>see the very stars out!
</br>
</br>Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
</br>chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
</br>open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and
</br>fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in
</br>body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have
</br>been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never
</br>troubled it.
</br>
</br>Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one
</br>happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably
</br>passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of
</br>Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due
</br>course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
</br>sprites, and was seen no more.
</br>
</br>The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
</br>and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
</br>but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
</br>and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
</br>way out.
</br>
</br>“I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
</br>and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”
</br>
</br>With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
</br>dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.
</br>
</br>He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and
</br>with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every
</br>feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
</br>beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top
</br>of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little
</br>change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing
</br>colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
</br>by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of
</br>treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with
</br>attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
</br>line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much
</br>too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a
</br>handsome face, and a remarkable one.
</br>
</br>Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and
</br>drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had
</br>stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer
</br>in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable
</br>to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and
</br>often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were
</br>charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
</br>check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had
</br>sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,
</br>that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician
</br>custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
</br>barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second
</br>time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
</br>left to get out of their difficulties as they could.
</br>
</br>With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of
</br>consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage
</br>dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming
</br>before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
</br>its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
</br>wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a
</br>number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
</br>
</br>But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have
</br>stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded
</br>behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,
</br>and there were twenty hands at the horses’ bridles.
</br>
</br>“What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.
</br>
</br>A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
</br>the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was
</br>down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.
</br>
</br>“Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is
</br>a child.”
</br>
</br>“Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?”
</br>
</br>“Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.”
</br>
</br>The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
</br>into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly
</br>got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
</br>Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.
</br>
</br>“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
</br>their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”
</br>
</br>The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was
</br>nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
</br>and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the
</br>people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
</br>remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
</br>and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes
</br>over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.
</br>
</br>He took out his purse.
</br>
</br>“It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care
</br>of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in
</br>the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give
</br>him that.”
</br>
</br>He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
</br>craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The
</br>tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”
</br>
</br>He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest
</br>made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,
</br>sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were
</br>stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They
</br>were as silent, however, as the men.
</br>
</br>“I know all, I know all,” said the last comer. “Be a brave man, my
</br>Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to
</br>live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour
</br>as happily?”
</br>
</br>“You are a philosopher, you there,” said the Marquis, smiling. “How do
</br>they call you?”
</br>
</br>“They call me Defarge.”
</br>
</br>“Of what trade?”
</br>
</br>“Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”
</br>
</br>“Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis,
</br>throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will. The horses
</br>there; are they right?”
</br>
</br>Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the
</br>Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the
</br>air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had
</br>paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly
</br>disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.
</br>
</br>“Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. “Hold the horses! Who threw that?”
</br>
</br>He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a
</br>moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
</br>the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
</br>figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
</br>
</br>“You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,
</br>except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very
</br>willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal
</br>threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he
</br>should be crushed under the wheels.”
</br>
</br>So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of
</br>what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not
</br>a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.
</br>But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the
</br>Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his
</br>contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he
</br>leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”
</br>
</br>He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
</br>succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
</br>Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
</br>whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
</br>had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking
</br>on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the
</br>spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through
</br>which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and
</br>bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle
</br>while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running
</br>of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who
</br>had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness
</br>of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
</br>into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,
</br>time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together
</br>in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all
</br>things ran their course.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>VIII. Monseigneur in the Country
</br>
</br>
</br>A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
</br>Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
</br>and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
</br>inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
</br>tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
</br>disposition to give up, and wither away.
</br>
</br>Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been
</br>lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up
</br>a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was
</br>no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
</br>occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting
</br>sun.
</br>
</br>The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
</br>gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. “It will
</br>die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”
</br>
</br>In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
</br>heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
</br>hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
</br>quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow
</br>left when the drag was taken off.
</br>
</br>But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
</br>at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a
</br>church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a
</br>fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects
</br>as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
</br>coming near home.
</br>
</br>The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor
</br>tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor
</br>fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All
</br>its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,
</br>shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the
</br>fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of
</br>the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,
</br>were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
</br>for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be
</br>paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
</br>the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.
</br>
</br>Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,
</br>their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest
</br>terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;
</br>or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.
</br>
</br>Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions’
</br>whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as
</br>if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in
</br>his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
</br>fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
</br>He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow
</br>sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the
</br>meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
</br>truth through the best part of a hundred years.
</br>
</br>Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
</br>drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before
</br>Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces
</br>drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender
</br>of the roads joined the group.
</br>
</br>“Bring me hither that fellow!” said the Marquis to the courier.
</br>
</br>The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round
</br>to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.
</br>
</br>“I passed you on the road?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road.”
</br>
</br>“Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, it is true.”
</br>
</br>“What did you look at, so fixedly?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, I looked at the man.”
</br>
</br>He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
</br>carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.
</br>
</br>“What man, pig? And why look there?”
</br>
</br>“Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.”
</br>
</br>“Who?” demanded the traveller.
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, the man.”
</br>
</br>“May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You
</br>know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?”
</br>
</br>“Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of
</br>all the days of my life, I never saw him.”
</br>
</br>“Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?”
</br>
</br>“With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.
</br>His head hanging over--like this!”
</br>
</br>He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his
</br>face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered
</br>himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.
</br>
</br>“What was he like?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
</br>white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”
</br>
</br>The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
</br>eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
</br>the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
</br>conscience.
</br>
</br>“Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
</br>vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my carriage,
</br>and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur
</br>Gabelle!”
</br>
</br>Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
</br>united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
</br>examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
</br>official manner.
</br>
</br>“Bah! Go aside!” said Monsieur Gabelle.
</br>
</br>“Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
</br>to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.”
</br>
</br>“Did he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?”
</br>
</br>The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
</br>particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some
</br>half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and
</br>presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.
</br>
</br>“Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
</br>a person plunges into the river.”
</br>
</br>“See to it, Gabelle. Go on!”
</br>
</br>The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
</br>wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
</br>to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
</br>they might not have been so fortunate.
</br>
</br>The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
</br>rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
</br>it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
</br>sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
</br>gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
</br>points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
</br>courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.
</br>
</br>At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,
</br>with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor
</br>figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had
</br>studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was
</br>dreadfully spare and thin.
</br>
</br>To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
</br>growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She
</br>turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and
</br>presented herself at the carriage-door.
</br>
</br>“It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.”
</br>
</br>With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
</br>Monseigneur looked out.
</br>
</br>“How, then! What is it? Always petitions!”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester.”
</br>
</br>“What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He
</br>cannot pay something?”
</br>
</br>“He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.”
</br>
</br>“Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?”
</br>
</br>“Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor
</br>grass.”
</br>
</br>“Well?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”
</br>
</br>“Again, well?”
</br>
</br>She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate
</br>grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together
</br>with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,
</br>caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to
</br>feel the appealing touch.
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of
</br>want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.”
</br>
</br>“Again, well? Can I feed them?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don’t ask it. My petition is,
</br>that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband’s name, may be placed
</br>over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly
</br>forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I
</br>shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they
</br>are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur!
</br>Monseigneur!”
</br>
</br>The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into
</br>a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far
</br>behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
</br>diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
</br>his chateau.
</br>
</br>The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as
</br>the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
</br>at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid
</br>of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his
</br>man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they
</br>could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
</br>in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
</br>stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
</br>been extinguished.
</br>
</br>The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,
</br>was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged
</br>for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door
</br>of his chateau was opened to him.
</br>
</br>“Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, not yet.”
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>IX. The Gorgon’s Head
</br>
</br>
</br>It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
</br>with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of
</br>staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony
</br>business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and
</br>stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in
</br>all directions. As if the Gorgon’s head had surveyed it, when it was
</br>finished, two centuries ago.
</br>
</br>Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau
</br>preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness
</br>to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
</br>of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the
</br>flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
</br>door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being
</br>in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl’s voice there was none,
</br>save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of
</br>those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then
</br>heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.
</br>
</br>The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a
</br>hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;
</br>grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a
</br>peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord
</br>was angry.
</br>
</br>Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,
</br>Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up
</br>the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him
</br>to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two
</br>others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon
</br>the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries
</br>befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.
</br>The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
</br>break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
</br>but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
</br>pages in the history of France.
</br>
</br>A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
</br>room, in one of the chateau’s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small
</br>lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
</br>closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
</br>black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.
</br>
</br>“My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; “they
</br>said he was not arrived.”
</br>
</br>Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.
</br>
</br>“Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the
</br>table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”
</br>
</br>In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his
</br>sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and
</br>he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his
</br>lips, when he put it down.
</br>
</br>“What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the
</br>horizontal lines of black and stone colour.
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur? That?”
</br>
</br>“Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”
</br>
</br>It was done.
</br>
</br>“Well?”
</br>
</br>“Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are
</br>here.”
</br>
</br>The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into
</br>the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round
</br>for instructions.
</br>
</br>“Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”
</br>
</br>That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was
</br>half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,
</br>hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the
</br>front of the chateau.
</br>
</br>“Ask who is arrived.”
</br>
</br>It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind
</br>Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance
</br>rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.
</br>He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.
</br>
</br>He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and
</br>there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.
</br>He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.
</br>
</br>Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake
</br>hands.
</br>
</br>“You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his
</br>seat at table.
</br>
</br>“Yesterday. And you?”
</br>
</br>“I come direct.”
</br>
</br>“From London?”
</br>
</br>“Yes.”
</br>
</br>“You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile.
</br>
</br>“On the contrary; I come direct.”
</br>
</br>“Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
</br>intending the journey.”
</br>
</br>“I have been detained by”--the nephew stopped a moment in his
</br>answer--“various business.”
</br>
</br>“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.
</br>
</br>So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.
</br>When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,
</br>looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
</br>fine mask, opened a conversation.
</br>
</br>“I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
</br>took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
</br>a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
</br>sustained me.”
</br>
</br>“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”
</br>
</br>“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to
</br>the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”
</br>
</br>The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight
</br>lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a
</br>graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good
</br>breeding that it was not reassuring.
</br>
</br>“Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may have
</br>expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
</br>circumstances that surrounded me.”
</br>
</br>“No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.
</br>
</br>“But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with
</br>deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,
</br>and would know no scruple as to means.”
</br>
</br>“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the
</br>two marks. “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”
</br>
</br>“I recall it.”
</br>
</br>“Thank you,” said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.
</br>
</br>His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical
</br>instrument.
</br>
</br>“In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your
</br>bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
</br>France here.”
</br>
</br>“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
</br>“Dare I ask you to explain?”
</br>
</br>“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not
</br>been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would
</br>have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”
</br>
</br>“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “For the honour
</br>of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
</br>Pray excuse me!”
</br>
</br>“I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
</br>yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.
</br>
</br>“I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined
</br>politeness; “I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for
</br>consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence
</br>your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
</br>yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,
</br>at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle
</br>aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that
</br>might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest
</br>and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted
</br>(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such
</br>things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right
</br>of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such
</br>dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),
</br>one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing
</br>some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have
</br>lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the
</br>assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as
</br>to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very
</br>bad!”
</br>
</br>The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
</br>as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
</br>containing himself, that great means of regeneration.
</br>
</br>“We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern
</br>time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be
</br>more detested than any name in France.”
</br>
</br>“Let us hope so,” said the uncle. “Detestation of the high is the
</br>involuntary homage of the low.”
</br>
</br>“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can
</br>look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
</br>deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”
</br>
</br>“A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,
</br>merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
</br>Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
</br>crossed his legs.
</br>
</br>But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes
</br>thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
</br>him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,
</br>and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of
</br>indifference.
</br>
</br>“Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear
</br>and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs
</br>obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts
</br>out the sky.”
</br>
</br>That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the
</br>chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
</br>they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
</br>him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
</br>the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof
</br>he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new
</br>way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
</br>was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.
</br>
</br>“Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and repose
</br>of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
</br>terminate our conference for the night?”
</br>
</br>“A moment more.”
</br>
</br>“An hour, if you please.”
</br>
</br>“Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits
</br>of wrong.”
</br>
</br>“_We_ have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,
</br>and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.
</br>
</br>“Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account
</br>to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father’s time, we did
</br>a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and
</br>our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father’s time,
</br>when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father’s twin-brother, joint
</br>inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”
</br>
</br>“Death has done that!” said the Marquis.
</br>
</br>“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is
</br>frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to
</br>execute the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last
</br>look of my dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to
</br>redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”
</br>
</br>“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the
</br>breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you
</br>will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”
</br>
</br>Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was
</br>cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking
</br>quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he
</br>touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of
</br>a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the
</br>body, and said,
</br>
</br>“My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
</br>lived.”
</br>
</br>When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his
</br>box in his pocket.
</br>
</br>“Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small
</br>bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,
</br>Monsieur Charles, I see.”
</br>
</br>“This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I
</br>renounce them.”
</br>
</br>“Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It
</br>is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”
</br>
</br>“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
</br>to me from you, to-morrow--”
</br>
</br>“Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”
</br>
</br>“--or twenty years hence--”
</br>
</br>“You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that
</br>supposition.”
</br>
</br>“--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to
</br>relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”
</br>
</br>“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.
</br>
</br>“To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,
</br>under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,
</br>mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,
</br>and suffering.”
</br>
</br>“Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.
</br>
</br>“If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better
</br>qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the
</br>weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave
</br>it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in
</br>another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse
</br>on it, and on all this land.”
</br>
</br>“And you?” said the uncle. “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new
</br>philosophy, graciously intend to live?”
</br>
</br>“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at
</br>their backs, may have to do some day--work.”
</br>
</br>“In England, for example?”
</br>
</br>“Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
</br>family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”
</br>
</br>The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be
</br>lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The
</br>Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
</br>valet.
</br>
</br>“England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
</br>prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
</br>with a smile.
</br>
</br>“I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may
</br>be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.”
</br>
</br>“They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You
</br>know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?”
</br>
</br>“Yes.”
</br>
</br>“With a daughter?”
</br>
</br>“Yes.”
</br>
</br>“Yes,” said the Marquis. “You are fatigued. Good night!”
</br>
</br>As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
</br>in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
</br>which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same
</br>time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin
</br>straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that
</br>looked handsomely diabolic.
</br>
</br>“Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
</br>commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!”
</br>
</br>It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
</br>outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew
</br>looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.
</br>
</br>“Good night!” said the uncle. “I look to the pleasure of seeing you
</br>again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his
</br>chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he
</br>added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his
</br>valet to his own bedroom.
</br>
</br>The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his
</br>loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still
</br>night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no
</br>noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some
</br>enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose
</br>periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just
</br>coming on.
</br>
</br>He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the
</br>scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow
</br>toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the
</br>prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at
</br>the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
</br>chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
</br>the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
</br>tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”
</br>
</br>“I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”
</br>
</br>So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin
</br>gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence
</br>with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.
</br>
</br>The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
</br>for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
</br>rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
</br>very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
</br>the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
</br>hardly ever to say what is set down for them.
</br>
</br>For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
</br>stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
</br>dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
</br>The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
</br>were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
</br>have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
</br>taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
</br>the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
</br>the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
</br>freed.
</br>
</br>The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain
</br>at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the
</br>minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark
</br>hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,
</br>and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.
</br>
</br>Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
</br>trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water
</br>of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces
</br>crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the
</br>weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur
</br>the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
</br>At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open
</br>mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.
</br>
</br>Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement
</br>windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
</br>shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely
</br>lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the
</br>fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
</br>and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows
</br>out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church
</br>and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter
</br>prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
</br>foot.
</br>
</br>The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and
</br>surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been
</br>reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;
</br>now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked
</br>round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
</br>doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs
</br>pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.
</br>
</br>All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
</br>return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
</br>chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried
</br>figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
</br>everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?
</br>
</br>What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
</br>at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day’s dinner (not
</br>much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow’s while to
</br>peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
</br>to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or
</br>no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,
</br>down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the
</br>fountain.
</br>
</br>All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about
</br>in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other
</br>emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought
</br>in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
</br>on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
</br>trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
</br>the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
</br>all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
</br>on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
</br>highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated
</br>into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
</br>himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,
</br>and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind
</br>a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle
</br>(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of
</br>the German ballad of Leonora?
</br>
</br>It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.
</br>
</br>The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
</br>the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
</br>through about two hundred years.
</br>
</br>It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
</br>mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the
</br>heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
</br>was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:
</br>
</br>“Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.”
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>X. Two Promises
</br>
</br>
</br>More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles
</br>Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French
</br>language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he
</br>would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with
</br>young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
</br>living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for
</br>its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in
</br>sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not
</br>at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
</br>to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
</br>dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a
</br>tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and
</br>profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
</br>work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became
</br>known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the
</br>circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.
</br>So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.
</br>
</br>In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
</br>to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he
</br>would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and
</br>did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.
</br>
</br>A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
</br>read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
</br>contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
</br>and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in
</br>London.
</br>
</br>Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days
</br>when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
</br>invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay’s way--the way of the love of a
</br>woman.
</br>
</br>He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never
</br>heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;
</br>he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
</br>confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
</br>him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination
</br>at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
</br>long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
</br>mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so
</br>much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.
</br>
</br>That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a
</br>summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
</br>he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
</br>of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer
</br>day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.
</br>
</br>He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy
</br>which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
</br>their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a
</br>very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
</br>of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was
</br>sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the
</br>exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
</br>frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.
</br>
</br>He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
</br>ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at
</br>sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.
</br>
</br>“Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your
</br>return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were
</br>both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.”
</br>
</br>“I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered,
</br>a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. “Miss
</br>Manette--”
</br>
</br>“Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return will
</br>delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will
</br>soon be home.”
</br>
</br>“Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her
</br>being from home, to beg to speak to you.”
</br>
</br>There was a blank silence.
</br>
</br>“Yes?” said the Doctor, with evident constraint. “Bring your chair here,
</br>and speak on.”
</br>
</br>He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less
</br>easy.
</br>
</br>“I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,”
</br> so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the topic
</br>on which I am about to touch may not--”
</br>
</br>He was stayed by the Doctor’s putting out his hand to stop him. When he
</br>had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:
</br>
</br>“Is Lucie the topic?”
</br>
</br>“She is.”
</br>
</br>“It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me
</br>to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.”
</br>
</br>“It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor
</br>Manette!” he said deferentially.
</br>
</br>There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:
</br>
</br>“I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.”
</br>
</br>His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
</br>originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
</br>Darnay hesitated.
</br>
</br>“Shall I go on, sir?”
</br>
</br>Another blank.
</br>
</br>“Yes, go on.”
</br>
</br>“You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
</br>I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
</br>the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
</br>laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
</br>disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love
</br>her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”
</br>
</br>The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
</br>ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
</br>and cried:
</br>
</br>“Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!”
</br>
</br>His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles
</br>Darnay’s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had
</br>extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter
</br>so received it, and remained silent.
</br>
</br>“I ask your pardon,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
</br>moments. “I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.”
</br>
</br>He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
</br>raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
</br>overshadowed his face:
</br>
</br>“Have you spoken to Lucie?”
</br>
</br>“No.”
</br>
</br>“Nor written?”
</br>
</br>“Never.”
</br>
</br>“It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
</br>to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
</br>you.”
</br>
</br>He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.
</br>
</br>“I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor
</br>Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
</br>you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
</br>belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
</br>can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
</br>child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
</br>with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
</br>is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
</br>itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
</br>now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
</br>years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
</br>early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if
</br>you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
</br>hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
</br>in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to
</br>you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
</br>neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
</br>own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
</br>loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
</br>have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”
</br>
</br>Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a
</br>little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.
</br>
</br>“Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
</br>with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
</br>long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
</br>now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
</br>your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.
</br>Heaven is my witness that I love her!”
</br>
</br>“I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully. “I have thought so
</br>before now. I believe it.”
</br>
</br>“But, do not believe,” said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice
</br>struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast as
</br>that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time
</br>put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a
</br>word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I
</br>should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at
</br>a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
</br>heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not
</br>now touch this honoured hand.”
</br>
</br>He laid his own upon it as he spoke.
</br>
</br>“No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like
</br>you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
</br>you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
</br>in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
</br>life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide
</br>with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
</br>come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”
</br>
</br>His touch still lingered on her father’s hand. Answering the touch for a
</br>moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of
</br>his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
</br>conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
</br>occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.
</br>
</br>“You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank
</br>you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have
</br>you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?”
</br>
</br>“None. As yet, none.”
</br>
</br>“Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
</br>ascertain that, with my knowledge?”
</br>
</br>“Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
</br>might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”
</br>
</br>“Do you seek any guidance from me?”
</br>
</br>“I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it
</br>in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.”
</br>
</br>“Do you seek any promise from me?”
</br>
</br>“I do seek that.”
</br>
</br>“What is it?”
</br>
</br>“I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
</br>understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
</br>innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I
</br>could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”
</br>
</br>“If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”
</br>
</br>“I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor’s
</br>favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,
</br>Doctor Manette,” said Darnay, modestly but firmly, “I would not ask that
</br>word, to save my life.”
</br>
</br>“I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
</br>well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
</br>delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
</br>respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
</br>heart.”
</br>
</br>“May I ask, sir, if you think she is--” As he hesitated, her father
</br>supplied the rest.
</br>
</br>“Is sought by any other suitor?”
</br>
</br>“It is what I meant to say.”
</br>
</br>Her father considered a little before he answered:
</br>
</br>“You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
</br>occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”
</br>
</br>“Or both,” said Darnay.
</br>
</br>“I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want
</br>a promise from me. Tell me what it is.”
</br>
</br>“It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own
</br>part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will
</br>bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you
</br>may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
</br>me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The
</br>condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
</br>require, I will observe immediately.”
</br>
</br>“I give the promise,” said the Doctor, “without any condition. I believe
</br>your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I
</br>believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
</br>between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me
</br>that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.
</br>If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--”
</br>
</br>The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
</br>the Doctor spoke:
</br>
</br>“--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
</br>new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility
</br>thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her
</br>sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
</br>than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.”
</br>
</br>So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
</br>his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
</br>hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.
</br>
</br>“You said something to me,” said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.
</br>“What was it you said to me?”
</br>
</br>He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
</br>condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:
</br>
</br>“Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
</br>part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother’s, is
</br>not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and
</br>why I am in England.”
</br>
</br>“Stop!” said the Doctor of Beauvais.
</br>
</br>“I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no
</br>secret from you.”
</br>
</br>“Stop!”
</br>
</br>For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
</br>another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay’s lips.
</br>
</br>“Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie
</br>should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you
</br>promise?”
</br>
</br>“Willingly.
</br>
</br>“Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she
</br>should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!”
</br>
</br>It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
</br>darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
</br>Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
</br>reading-chair empty.
</br>
</br>“My father!” she called to him. “Father dear!”
</br>
</br>Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his
</br>bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
</br>his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
</br>blood all chilled, “What shall I do! What shall I do!”
</br>
</br>Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at
</br>his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of
</br>her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down
</br>together for a long time.
</br>
</br>She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He
</br>slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished
</br>work, were all as usual.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>XI. A Companion Picture
</br>
</br>
</br>“Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
</br>jackal; “mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.”
</br>
</br>Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,
</br>and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
</br>a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver’s papers before the setting in
</br>of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
</br>arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
</br>November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
</br>bring grist to the mill again.
</br>
</br>Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
</br>application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him
</br>through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
</br>the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
</br>his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
</br>intervals for the last six hours.
</br>
</br>“Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said Stryver the portly, with
</br>his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
</br>his back.
</br>
</br>“I am.”
</br>
</br>“Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
</br>surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
</br>shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.”
</br>
</br>“_Do_ you?”
</br>
</br>“Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?”
</br>
</br>“I don’t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?”
</br>
</br>“Guess.”
</br>
</br>“Do I know her?”
</br>
</br>“Guess.”
</br>
</br>“I am not going to guess, at five o’clock in the morning, with my brains
</br>frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask
</br>me to dinner.”
</br>
</br>“Well then, I’ll tell you,” said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
</br>posture. “Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
</br>because you are such an insensible dog.”
</br>
</br>“And you,” returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, “are such a
</br>sensitive and poetical spirit--”
</br>
</br>“Come!” rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, “though I don’t prefer
</br>any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still
</br>I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.”
</br>
</br>“You are a luckier, if you mean that.”
</br>
</br>“I don’t mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--”
</br>
</br>“Say gallantry, while you are about it,” suggested Carton.
</br>
</br>“Well! I’ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,” said Stryver,
</br>inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares more to
</br>be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
</br>to be agreeable, in a woman’s society, than you do.”
</br>
</br>“Go on,” said Sydney Carton.
</br>
</br>“No; but before I go on,” said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
</br>way, “I’ll have this out with you. You’ve been at Doctor Manette’s house
</br>as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your
</br>moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
</br>hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,
</br>Sydney!”
</br>
</br>“It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to
</br>be ashamed of anything,” returned Sydney; “you ought to be much obliged
</br>to me.”
</br>
</br>“You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
</br>rejoinder at him; “no, Sydney, it’s my duty to tell you--and I tell you
</br>to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
</br>fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.”
</br>
</br>Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.
</br>
</br>“Look at me!” said Stryver, squaring himself; “I have less need to make
</br>myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
</br>Why do I do it?”
</br>
</br>“I never saw you do it yet,” muttered Carton.
</br>
</br>“I do it because it’s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
</br>get on.”
</br>
</br>“You don’t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,”
</br> answered Carton, with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to that. As
</br>to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?”
</br>
</br>He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.
</br>
</br>“You have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend’s answer,
</br>delivered in no very soothing tone.
</br>
</br>“I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,” said Sydney Carton.
</br>“Who is the lady?”
</br>
</br>“Now, don’t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,
</br>Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
</br>for the disclosure he was about to make, “because I know you don’t mean
</br>half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I
</br>make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
</br>me in slighting terms.”
</br>
</br>“I did?”
</br>
</br>“Certainly; and in these chambers.”
</br>
</br>Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;
</br>drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.
</br>
</br>“You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young
</br>lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
</br>delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a
</br>little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
</br>You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I
</br>think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man’s opinion of
</br>a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
</br>of mine, who had no ear for music.”
</br>
</br>Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
</br>looking at his friend.
</br>
</br>“Now you know all about it, Syd,” said Mr. Stryver. “I don’t care about
</br>fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to
</br>please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She
</br>will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
</br>and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her,
</br>but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?”
</br>
</br>Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be
</br>astonished?”
</br>
</br>“You approve?”
</br>
</br>Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”
</br>
</br>“Well!” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied
</br>you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
</br>be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
</br>ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had
</br>enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I
</br>feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
</br>inclined to go to it (when he doesn’t, he can stay away), and I feel
</br>that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
</br>credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
</br>say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you
</br>know; you really are in a bad way. You don’t know the value of money,
</br>you live hard, you’ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
</br>you really ought to think about a nurse.”
</br>
</br>The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as
</br>big as he was, and four times as offensive.
</br>
</br>“Now, let me recommend you,” pursued Stryver, “to look it in the face.
</br>I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,
</br>you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of
</br>you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women’s society, nor
</br>understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
</br>respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,
</br>or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. That’s the
</br>kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney.”
</br>
</br>“I’ll think of it,” said Sydney.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>XII. The Fellow of Delicacy
</br>
</br>
</br>Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
</br>fortune on the Doctor’s daughter, resolved to make her happiness known
</br>to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental
</br>debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as
</br>well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange
</br>at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
</br>before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
</br>and Hilary.
</br>
</br>As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly
</br>saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly
</br>grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a
</br>plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the
</br>plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for
</br>the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to
</br>consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer
</br>case could be.
</br>
</br>Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal
</br>proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to
</br>Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
</br>himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.
</br>
</br>Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,
</br>while the bloom of the Long Vacation’s infancy was still upon it.
</br>Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet
</br>on Saint Dunstan’s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way
</br>along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have
</br>seen how safe and strong he was.
</br>
</br>His way taking him past Tellson’s, and he both banking at Tellson’s and
</br>knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.
</br>Stryver’s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness
</br>of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
</br>in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient
</br>cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.
</br>Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
</br>bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
</br>under the clouds were a sum.
</br>
</br>“Halloa!” said Mr. Stryver. “How do you do? I hope you are well!”
</br>
</br>It was Stryver’s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
</br>place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson’s, that old clerks
</br>in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
</br>squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading
</br>the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
</br>the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.
</br>
</br>The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would
</br>recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do
</br>you do, sir?” and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner
</br>of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson’s who shook
</br>hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a
</br>self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.
</br>
</br>“Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?” asked Mr. Lorry, in his
</br>business character.
</br>
</br>“Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
</br>have come for a private word.”
</br>
</br>“Oh indeed!” said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed
</br>to the House afar off.
</br>
</br>“I am going,” said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
</br>desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
</br>be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself
</br>in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.”
</br>
</br>“Oh dear me!” cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
</br>visitor dubiously.
</br>
</br>“Oh dear me, sir?” repeated Stryver, drawing back. “Oh dear you, sir?
</br>What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?”
</br>
</br>“My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course, friendly and
</br>appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
</br>my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.
</br>Stryver--” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest
</br>manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,
</br>“you know there really is so much too much of you!”
</br>
</br>“Well!” said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
</br>opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, “if I understand you,
</br>Mr. Lorry, I’ll be hanged!”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
</br>end, and bit the feather of a pen.
</br>
</br>“D--n it all, sir!” said Stryver, staring at him, “am I not eligible?”
</br>
</br>“Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you’re eligible!” said Mr. Lorry. “If you say
</br>eligible, you are eligible.”
</br>
</br>“Am I not prosperous?” asked Stryver.
</br>
</br>“Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said Mr. Lorry.
</br>
</br>“And advancing?”
</br>
</br>“If you come to advancing you know,” said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be
</br>able to make another admission, “nobody can doubt that.”
</br>
</br>“Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded Stryver,
</br>perceptibly crestfallen.
</br>
</br>“Well! I--Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry.
</br>
</br>“Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.
</br>
</br>“Then I think I wouldn’t, if I was you.”
</br>
</br>“Why?” said Stryver. “Now, I’ll put you in a corner,” forensically
</br>shaking a forefinger at him. “You are a man of business and bound to
</br>have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn’t you go?”
</br>
</br>“Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn’t go on such an object without
</br>having some cause to believe that I should succeed.”
</br>
</br>“D--n _me_!” cried Stryver, “but this beats everything.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
</br>Stryver.
</br>
</br>“Here’s a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_
</br>a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons for
</br>complete success, he says there’s no reason at all! Says it with his
</br>head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
</br>been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.
</br>
</br>“When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and
</br>when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of
</br>causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young
</br>lady, my good sir,” said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, “the
</br>young lady. The young lady goes before all.”
</br>
</br>“Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his
</br>elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
</br>present in question is a mincing Fool?”
</br>
</br>“Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry,
</br>reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
</br>from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose
</br>taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could
</br>not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
</br>this desk, not even Tellson’s should prevent my giving him a piece of my
</br>mind.”
</br>
</br>The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver’s
</br>blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;
</br>Mr. Lorry’s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
</br>no better state now it was his turn.
</br>
</br>“That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said Mr. Lorry. “Pray let there
</br>be no mistake about it.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
</br>hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the
</br>toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:
</br>
</br>“This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not
</br>to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King’s Bench
</br>bar?”
</br>
</br>“Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?”
</br>
</br>“Yes, I do.”
</br>
</br>“Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”
</br>
</br>“And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that
</br>this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.”
</br>
</br>“Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. “As a man of business, I am
</br>not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
</br>business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
</br>Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and
</br>of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have
</br>spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I
</br>may not be right?”
</br>
</br>“Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. “I can’t undertake to find third
</br>parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense
</br>in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It’s
</br>new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”
</br>
</br>“What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And
</br>understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I
</br>will not--not even at Tellson’s--have it characterised for me by any
</br>gentleman breathing.”
</br>
</br>“There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.
</br>
</br>“Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
</br>painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
</br>Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
</br>painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You
</br>know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with
</br>the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
</br>in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
</br>little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
</br>it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
</br>soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
</br>with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
</br>best spared. What do you say?”
</br>
</br>“How long would you keep me in town?”
</br>
</br>“Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the
</br>evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”
</br>
</br>“Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won’t go up there now, I am not so
</br>hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
</br>in to-night. Good morning.”
</br>
</br>Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
</br>concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it
</br>bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
</br>of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were
</br>always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly
</br>believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in
</br>the empty office until they bowed another customer in.
</br>
</br>The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
</br>gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
</br>moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
</br>swallow, he got it down. “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
</br>forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my way
</br>out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”
</br>
</br>It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
</br>great relief. “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr.
</br>Stryver; “I’ll do that for you.”
</br>
</br>Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock,
</br>Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
</br>purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
</br>the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
</br>altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.
</br>
</br>“Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
</br>bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. “I have been to
</br>Soho.”
</br>
</br>“To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. “Oh, to be sure! What am I
</br>thinking of!”
</br>
</br>“And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the
</br>conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my
</br>advice.”
</br>
</br>“I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I
</br>am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father’s
</br>account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
</br>us say no more about it.”
</br>
</br>“I don’t understand you,” said Mr. Lorry.
</br>
</br>“I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and
</br>final way; “no matter, no matter.”
</br>
</br>“But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged.
</br>
</br>“No it doesn’t; I assure you it doesn’t. Having supposed that there was
</br>sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is
</br>not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is
</br>done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have
</br>repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish
</br>aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been
</br>a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am
</br>glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing
</br>for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could
</br>have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not
</br>proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means
</br>certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to
</br>that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and
</br>giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you
</br>will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,
</br>I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
</br>And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
</br>and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;
</br>you were right, it never would have done.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
</br>Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
</br>showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
</br>“Make the best of it, my dear sir,” said Stryver; “say no more about it;
</br>thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!”
</br>
</br>Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver
</br>was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy
</br>
</br>
</br>If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
</br>house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,
</br>and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he
</br>cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
</br>which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
</br>pierced by the light within him.
</br>
</br>And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
</br>and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night
</br>he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
</br>transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
</br>figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
</br>of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
</br>in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time
</br>brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
</br>into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known
</br>him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
</br>it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
</br>neighbourhood.
</br>
</br>On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
</br>that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his
</br>delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
</br>City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
</br>for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney’s feet still trod
</br>those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became
</br>animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,
</br>they took him to the Doctor’s door.
</br>
</br>He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had
</br>never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little
</br>embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at
</br>his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed
</br>a change in it.
</br>
</br>“I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!”
</br>
</br>“No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What
</br>is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?”
</br>
</br>“Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to
</br>live no better life?”
</br>
</br>“God knows it is a shame!”
</br>
</br>“Then why not change it?”
</br>
</br>Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that
</br>there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
</br>answered:
</br>
</br>“It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall
</br>sink lower, and be worse.”
</br>
</br>He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The
</br>table trembled in the silence that followed.
</br>
</br>She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to
</br>be so, without looking at her, and said:
</br>
</br>“Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of
</br>what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?”
</br>
</br>“If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
</br>it would make me very glad!”
</br>
</br>“God bless you for your sweet compassion!”
</br>
</br>He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.
</br>
</br>“Don’t be afraid to hear me. Don’t shrink from anything I say. I am like
</br>one who died young. All my life might have been.”
</br>
</br>“No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am
</br>sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.”
</br>
</br>“Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the
</br>mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget
</br>it!”
</br>
</br>She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair
</br>of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
</br>been holden.
</br>
</br>“If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the
</br>love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,
</br>poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been
</br>conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would
</br>bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,
</br>disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have
</br>no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot
</br>be.”
</br>
</br>“Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall
</br>you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
</br>confidence? I know this is a confidence,” she modestly said, after a
</br>little hesitation, and in earnest tears, “I know you would say this to
</br>no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?”
</br>
</br>He shook his head.
</br>
</br>“To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very
</br>little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that
</br>you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not
</br>been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this
</br>home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
</br>died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
</br>I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
</br>old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I
</br>have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
</br>sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all
</br>a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,
</br>but I wish you to know that you inspired it.”
</br>
</br>“Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!”
</br>
</br>“No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
</br>undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the
</br>weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,
</br>heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in
</br>its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
</br>service, idly burning away.”
</br>
</br>“Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy
</br>than you were before you knew me--”
</br>
</br>“Don’t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
</br>anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.”
</br>
</br>“Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
</br>attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can
</br>make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
</br>good, with you, at all?”
</br>
</br>“The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come
</br>here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,
</br>the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;
</br>and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
</br>deplore and pity.”
</br>
</br>“Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with
</br>all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!”
</br>
</br>“Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,
</br>and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let
</br>me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life
</br>was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
</br>alone, and will be shared by no one?”
</br>
</br>“If that will be a consolation to you, yes.”
</br>
</br>“Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?”
</br>
</br>“Mr. Carton,” she answered, after an agitated pause, “the secret is
</br>yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.”
</br>
</br>“Thank you. And again, God bless you.”
</br>
</br>He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.
</br>
</br>“Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
</br>conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it
</br>again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In
</br>the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and
</br>shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
</br>to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
</br>in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!”
</br>
</br>He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
</br>sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept
</br>down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he
</br>stood looking back at her.
</br>
</br>“Be comforted!” he said, “I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An
</br>hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn
</br>but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
</br>wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I
</br>shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be
</br>what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make
</br>to you, is, that you will believe this of me.”
</br>
</br>“I will, Mr. Carton.”
</br>
</br>“My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
</br>you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
</br>between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say
</br>it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to
</br>you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
</br>there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
</br>embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold
</br>me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
</br>thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
</br>ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
</br>and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
</br>grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a
</br>happy father’s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
</br>beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
</br>a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”
</br>
</br>He said, “Farewell!” said a last “God bless you!” and left her.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>XIV. The Honest Tradesman
</br>
</br>
</br>To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in
</br>Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and
</br>variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit
</br>upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and
</br>not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
</br>westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,
</br>both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
</br>the sun goes down!
</br>
</br>With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,
</br>like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
</br>watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
</br>running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
</br>since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
</br>women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from
</br>Tellson’s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such
</br>companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed
</br>to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
</br>have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from
</br>the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
</br>purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.
</br>
</br>Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in
</br>the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
</br>but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.
</br>
</br>It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
</br>few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
</br>unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
</br>Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an
</br>unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
</br>attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
</br>funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
</br>funeral, which engendered uproar.
</br>
</br>“Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it’s a
</br>buryin’.”
</br>
</br>“Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry.
</br>
</br>The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
</br>significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
</br>his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.
</br>
</br>“What d’ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey
</br>to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for
</br>_me_!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. “Him and his hooroars! Don’t
</br>let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D’ye
</br>hear?”
</br>
</br>“I warn’t doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.
</br>
</br>“Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won’t have none of _your_ no
</br>harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”
</br>
</br>His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing
</br>round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
</br>there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were
</br>considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position
</br>appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble
</br>surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and
</br>incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!”
</br> with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.
</br>
</br>Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he
</br>always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed
</br>Tellson’s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance
</br>excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:
</br>
</br>“What is it, brother? What’s it about?”
</br>
</br>“_I_ don’t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”
</br>
</br>He asked another man. “Who is it?”
</br>
</br>“_I_ don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
</br>nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
</br>greatest ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!”
</br>
</br>At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled
</br>against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
</br>funeral of one Roger Cly.
</br>
</br>“Was He a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.
</br>
</br>“Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. “Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey
</br>Spi--i--ies!”
</br>
</br>“Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had
</br>assisted. “I’ve seen him. Dead, is he?”
</br>
</br>“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can’t be too dead. Have ‘em
</br>out, there! Spies! Pull ‘em out, there! Spies!”
</br>
</br>The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,
</br>that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
</br>suggestion to have ‘em out, and to pull ‘em out, mobbed the two vehicles
</br>so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd’s opening the coach
</br>doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
</br>for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
</br>that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
</br>shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
</br>other symbolical tears.
</br>
</br>These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
</br>enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a
</br>crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.
</br>They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
</br>out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
</br>its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being
</br>much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
</br>the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
</br>while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
</br>exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
</br>was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from
</br>the observation of Tellson’s, in the further corner of the mourning
</br>coach.
</br>
</br>The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
</br>the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
</br>remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
</br>members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
</br>The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the
</br>hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under
</br>close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended
</br>by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a
</br>popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional
</br>ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his
</br>bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to
</br>that part of the procession in which he walked.
</br>
</br>Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
</br>caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
</br>at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination
</br>was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there
</br>in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
</br>accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and
</br>highly to its own satisfaction.
</br>
</br>The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of
</br>providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter
</br>genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
</br>passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
</br>was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
</br>the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
</br>they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of
</br>window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
</br>and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had
</br>been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm
</br>the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were
</br>coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps
</br>the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual
</br>progress of a mob.
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
</br>behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
</br>The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a
</br>neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and
</br>maturely considering the spot.
</br>
</br>“Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
</br>“you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
</br>was a young ‘un and a straight made ‘un.”
</br>
</br>Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
</br>himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
</br>station at Tellson’s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
</br>his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all
</br>amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
</br>man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon
</br>his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.
</br>
</br>Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No
</br>job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the
</br>usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.
</br>
</br>“Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
</br>entering. “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I
</br>shall make sure that you’ve been praying again me, and I shall work you
</br>for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”
</br>
</br>The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.
</br>
</br>“Why, you’re at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
</br>angry apprehension.
</br>
</br>“I am saying nothing.”
</br>
</br>“Well, then; don’t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.
</br>You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.”
</br>
</br>“Yes, Jerry.”
</br>
</br>“Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. “Ah! It _is_
</br>yes, Jerry. That’s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.”
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,
</br>but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general
</br>ironical dissatisfaction.
</br>
</br>“You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his
</br>bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
</br>oyster out of his saucer. “Ah! I think so. I believe you.”
</br>
</br>“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took
</br>another bite.
</br>
</br>“Yes, I am.”
</br>
</br>“May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly.
</br>
</br>“No, you mayn’t. I’m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That’s
</br>where I’m going to. Going a fishing.”
</br>
</br>“Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don’t it, father?”
</br>
</br>“Never you mind.”
</br>
</br>“Shall you bring any fish home, father?”
</br>
</br>“If I don’t, you’ll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that
</br>gentleman, shaking his head; “that’s questions enough for you; I ain’t a
</br>going out, till you’ve been long abed.”
</br>
</br>He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
</br>most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
</br>conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
</br>to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in
</br>conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
</br>on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than
</br>he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest
</br>person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
</br>honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a
</br>professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.
</br>
</br>“And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher. “No games to-morrow! If I, as a
</br>honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none
</br>of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
</br>tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
</br>on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
</br>customer to you, if you don’t. _I_‘m your Rome, you know.”
</br>
</br>Then he began grumbling again:
</br>
</br>“With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don’t
</br>know how scarce you mayn’t make the wittles and drink here, by your
</br>flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_
</br>your’n, ain’t he? He’s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,
</br>and not know that a mother’s first duty is to blow her boy out?”
</br>
</br>This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to
</br>perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
</br>all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
</br>function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.
</br>
</br>Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry
</br>was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
</br>obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
</br>solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
</br>o’clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,
</br>took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
</br>forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
</br>fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him
</br>in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
</br>extinguished the light, and went out.
</br>
</br>Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
</br>bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
</br>followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
</br>court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning
</br>his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the
</br>door stood ajar all night.
</br>
</br>Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
</br>father’s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
</br>walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his
</br>honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not
</br>gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and
</br>the two trudged on together.
</br>
</br>Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
</br>winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a
</br>lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,
</br>that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the
</br>second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split
</br>himself into two.
</br>
</br>The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
</br>under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low
</br>brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and
</br>wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which
</br>the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
</br>Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
</br>Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
</br>defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
</br>He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
</br>third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
</br>there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
</br>and knees.
</br>
</br>It was now Young Jerry’s turn to approach the gate: which he did,
</br>holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking
</br>in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
</br>and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard
</br>that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church
</br>tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not
</br>creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to
</br>fish.
</br>
</br>They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
</br>appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.
</br>Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful
</br>striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,
</br>with his hair as stiff as his father’s.
</br>
</br>But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
</br>only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They
</br>were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
</br>the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a
</br>screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were
</br>strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the
</br>earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what
</br>it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to
</br>wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he
</br>made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.
</br>
</br>He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,
</br>it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable
</br>to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
</br>was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt
</br>upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him
</br>and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to
</br>shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
</br>was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
</br>roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
</br>like a dropsical boy’s Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
</br>too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
</br>to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,
</br>and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was
</br>incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy
</br>got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then
</br>it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
</br>stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
</br>his breast when he fell asleep.
</br>
</br>From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after
</br>daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
</br>family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry
</br>inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the
</br>ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the
</br>bed.
</br>
</br>“I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”
</br>
</br>“Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored.
</br>
</br>“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me
</br>and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don’t
</br>you?”
</br>
</br>“I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with tears.
</br>
</br>“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband’s business? Is it
</br>honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
</br>husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”
</br>
</br>“You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”
</br>
</br>“It’s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a
</br>honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
</br>when he took to his trade or when he didn’t. A honouring and obeying
</br>wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious
</br>woman? If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have
</br>no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has
</br>of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”
</br>
</br>The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in
</br>the honest tradesman’s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down
</br>at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on
</br>his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay
</br>down too, and fell asleep again.
</br>
</br>There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
</br>Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid
</br>by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
</br>he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed
</br>and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
</br>ostensible calling.
</br>
</br>Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father’s side
</br>along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry
</br>from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and
</br>solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,
</br>and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not
</br>improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
</br>that fine morning.
</br>
</br>“Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep
</br>at arm’s length and to have the stool well between them: “what’s a
</br>Resurrection-Man?”
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How
</br>should I know?”
</br>
</br>“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.
</br>
</br>“Hem! Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his
</br>hat to give his spikes free play, “he’s a tradesman.”
</br>
</br>“What’s his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry.
</br>
</br>“His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, “is a
</br>branch of Scientific goods.”
</br>
</br>“Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?” asked the lively boy.
</br>
</br>“I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher.
</br>
</br>“Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I’m quite
</br>growed up!”
</br>
</br>Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.
</br>“It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop
</br>your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and
</br>there’s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
</br>for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,
</br>to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to
</br>himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there’s hopes wot that boy will
</br>yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!”
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>XV. Knitting
</br>
</br>
</br>There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
</br>Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
</br>through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
</br>measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
</br>of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
</br>he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
</br>influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No
</br>vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
</br>Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
</br>the dregs of it.
</br>
</br>This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been
</br>early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
</br>on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early
</br>brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
</br>slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
</br>not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These
</br>were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
</br>have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
</br>and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
</br>looks.
</br>
</br>Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop
</br>was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
</br>threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see
</br>only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of
</br>wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
</br>and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
</br>humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.
</br>
</br>A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
</br>observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
</br>at every place, high and low, from the king’s palace to the criminal’s
</br>gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
</br>towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
</br>of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
</br>with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
</br>a long way off.
</br>
</br>Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was
</br>high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
</br>his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a
</br>mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered
</br>the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
</br>of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
</br>flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had
</br>followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
</br>the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.
</br>
</br>“Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge.
</br>
</br>It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
</br>an answering chorus of “Good day!”
</br>
</br>“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head.
</br>
</br>Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down
</br>their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.
</br>
</br>“My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I have
</br>travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
</br>Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half’s journey out of Paris.
</br>He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to
</br>drink, my wife!”
</br>
</br>A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the
</br>mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,
</br>and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
</br>bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near
</br>Madame Defarge’s counter. A third man got up and went out.
</br>
</br>Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less
</br>than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
</br>rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
</br>He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
</br>Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.
</br>
</br>“Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season.
</br>
</br>“Yes, thank you.”
</br>
</br>“Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
</br>occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.”
</br>
</br>Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a
</br>courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the
</br>staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man
</br>sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
</br>
</br>No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had
</br>gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired
</br>man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at
</br>him through the chinks in the wall.
</br>
</br>Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:
</br>
</br>“Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness
</br>encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.
</br>Speak, Jacques Five!”
</br>
</br>The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with
</br>it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”
</br>
</br>“Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge’s not unreasonable reply, “at the
</br>commencement.”
</br>
</br>“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this
</br>running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the
</br>chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun
</br>going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he
</br>hanging by the chain--like this.”
</br>
</br>Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which
</br>he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
</br>the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
</br>during a whole year.
</br>
</br>Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?
</br>
</br>“Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.
</br>
</br>Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?
</br>
</br>“By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
</br>finger at his nose. “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
</br>‘Say, what is he like?’ I make response, ‘Tall as a spectre.’”
</br>
</br>“You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two.
</br>
</br>“But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he
</br>confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not
</br>offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,
</br>standing near our little fountain, and says, ‘To me! Bring that rascal!’
</br>My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”
</br>
</br>“He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had
</br>interrupted. “Go on!”
</br>
</br>“Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. “The tall man
</br>is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?”
</br>
</br>“No matter, the number,” said Defarge. “He is well hidden, but at last
</br>he is unluckily found. Go on!”
</br>
</br>“I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to
</br>go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
</br>village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see
</br>coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man
</br>with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!”
</br>
</br>With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
</br>elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.
</br>
</br>“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
</br>and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any
</br>spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I
</br>see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and
</br>that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun
</br>going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that
</br>their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
</br>road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
</br>Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
</br>with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near
</br>to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would
</br>be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as
</br>on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”
</br>
</br>He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
</br>vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.
</br>
</br>“I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not
</br>show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with
</br>our eyes. ‘Come on!’ says the chief of that company, pointing to the
</br>village, ‘bring him fast to his tomb!’ and they bring him faster. I
</br>follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden
</br>shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and
</br>consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!”
</br>
</br>He imitated the action of a man’s being impelled forward by the
</br>butt-ends of muskets.
</br>
</br>“As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They
</br>laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,
</br>but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into
</br>the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,
</br>and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
</br>darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!”
</br>
</br>He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding
</br>snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
</br>opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”
</br>
</br>“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
</br>voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
</br>village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
</br>locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,
</br>except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
</br>my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
</br>my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty
</br>iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no
</br>hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
</br>dead man.”
</br>
</br>Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all
</br>of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
</br>countryman’s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
</br>authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One
</br>and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on
</br>his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally
</br>intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding
</br>over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge
</br>standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the
</br>light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to
</br>him.
</br>
</br>“Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge.
</br>
</br>“He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks
</br>at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a
</br>distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work
</br>of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all
</br>faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards
</br>the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They
</br>whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be
</br>executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
</br>that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say
</br>that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?
</br>It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”
</br>
</br>“Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed.
</br>“Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,
</br>yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,
</br>sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the
</br>hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in
</br>his hand.”
</br>
</br>“And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three:
</br>his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a
</br>strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither
</br>food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,
</br>and struck him blows. You hear?”
</br>
</br>“I hear, messieurs.”
</br>
</br>“Go on then,” said Defarge.
</br>
</br>“Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the
</br>countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
</br>the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper
</br>that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the
</br>father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a
</br>parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed
</br>with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds
</br>which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be
</br>poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,
</br>that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man
</br>says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
</br>the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?
</br>I am not a scholar.”
</br>
</br>“Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless hand
</br>and the craving air. “The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was
</br>all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and
</br>nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than
</br>the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager
</br>attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
</br>when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
</br>done--why, how old are you?”
</br>
</br>“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.
</br>
</br>“It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen
</br>it.”
</br>
</br>“Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. “Long live the Devil! Go
</br>on.”
</br>
</br>“Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
</br>even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
</br>night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
</br>the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.
</br>Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by
</br>the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the
</br>water.”
</br>
</br>The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,
</br>and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.
</br>
</br>“All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
</br>the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers
</br>have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst
</br>of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is
</br>a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he
</br>laughed.” He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,
</br>from the corners of his mouth to his ears. “On the top of the gallows is
</br>fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged
</br>there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”
</br>
</br>They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,
</br>on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
</br>spectacle.
</br>
</br>“It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw
</br>water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have
</br>I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to
</br>bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,
</br>across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,
</br>messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”
</br>
</br>The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
</br>three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.
</br>
</br>“That’s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
</br>and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
</br>warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now
</br>walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here
</br>you see me!”
</br>
</br>After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good! You have acted
</br>and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the
</br>door?”
</br>
</br>“Very willingly,” said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the
</br>top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.
</br>
</br>The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to
</br>the garret.
</br>
</br>“How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One. “To be registered?”
</br>
</br>“To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge.
</br>
</br>“Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving.
</br>
</br>“The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first.
</br>
</br>“The chateau and all the race,” returned Defarge. “Extermination.”
</br>
</br>The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began
</br>gnawing another finger.
</br>
</br>“Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment
</br>can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is
</br>safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
</br>be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?”
</br>
</br>“Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my wife
</br>undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose
</br>a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her
</br>own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in
</br>Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
</br>to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
</br>crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”
</br>
</br>There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
</br>hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is
</br>very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”
</br>
</br>“He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than would
</br>easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself
</br>with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him
</br>on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and
</br>Court; let him see them on Sunday.”
</br>
</br>“What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring. “Is it a good sign, that he
</br>wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”
</br>
</br>“Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her
</br>to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
</br>him to bring it down one day.”
</br>
</br>Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already
</br>dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the
</br>pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon
</br>asleep.
</br>
</br>Worse quarters than Defarge’s wine-shop, could easily have been found
</br>in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious
</br>dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very
</br>new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly
</br>unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that
</br>his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that
</br>he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he
</br>contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
</br>might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it
</br>into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
</br>murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through
</br>with it until the play was played out.
</br>
</br>Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted
</br>(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
</br>and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have
</br>madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
</br>additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the
</br>afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
</br>see the carriage of the King and Queen.
</br>
</br>“You work hard, madame,” said a man near her.
</br>
</br>“Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”
</br>
</br>“What do you make, madame?”
</br>
</br>“Many things.”
</br>
</br>“For instance--”
</br>
</br>“For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”
</br>
</br>The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender
</br>of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close
</br>and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was
</br>fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King
</br>and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the
</br>shining Bull’s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
</br>ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
</br>and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
</br>sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary
</br>intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,
</br>Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of
</br>ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,
</br>terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull’s Eye,
</br>more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept
</br>with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three
</br>hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,
</br>and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him
</br>from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
</br>pieces.
</br>
</br>“Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a
</br>patron; “you are a good boy!”
</br>
</br>The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of
</br>having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.
</br>
</br>“You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear; “you make
</br>these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more
</br>insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”
</br>
</br>“Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that’s true.”
</br>
</br>“These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would
</br>stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than
</br>in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath
</br>tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
</br>deceive them too much.”
</br>
</br>Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
</br>confirmation.
</br>
</br>“As to you,” said she, “you would shout and shed tears for anything, if
</br>it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?”
</br>
</br>“Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment.”
</br>
</br>“If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to
</br>pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would
</br>pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?”
</br>
</br>“Truly yes, madame.”
</br>
</br>“Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
</br>set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
</br>you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?”
</br>
</br>“It is true, madame.”
</br>
</br>“You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,” said Madame Defarge, with
</br>a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;
</br>“now, go home!”
