        </br>Chapter 1
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,
        </br>for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there
        </br>he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed
        </br>one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by
        </br>contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any
        </br>unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally
        </br>into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations
        </br>of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he
        </br>could read his own history with an interest which never failed.  This
        </br>was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:
        </br>
        </br>           "ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.
        </br>
        </br>"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,
        </br>daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of
        </br>Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born
        </br>June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5,
        </br>1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."
        </br>
        </br>Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's
        </br>hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of
        </br>himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--
        </br>"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,
        </br>Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset," and by inserting most
        </br>accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.
        </br>
        </br>Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable
        </br>family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;
        </br>how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,
        </br>representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of
        </br>loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with
        </br>all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two
        </br>handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and
        </br>motto:--"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset," and
        </br>Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--
        </br>
        </br>"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the
        </br>second Sir Walter."
        </br>
        </br>Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;
        </br>vanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome in
        </br>his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.  Few women
        </br>could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could
        </br>the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held
        </br>in society.  He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to
        </br>the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united
        </br>these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and
        </br>devotion.
        </br>
        </br>His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since
        </br>to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any
        </br>thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,
        </br>sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be
        </br>pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never
        </br>required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or
        </br>concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for
        </br>seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world
        </br>herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children,
        </br>to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her
        </br>when she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest
        </br>sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an
        </br>awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a
        </br>conceited, silly father.  She had, however, one very intimate friend, a
        </br>sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment
        </br>to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on
        </br>her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help
        </br>and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had
        </br>been anxiously giving her daughters.
        </br>
        </br>This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been
        </br>anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years had
        </br>passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near
        </br>neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other
        </br>a widow.
        </br>
        </br>That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well
        </br>provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no
        </br>apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably
        </br>discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but
        </br>Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.  Be it
        </br>known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one
        </br>or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),
        </br>prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.  For
        </br>one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,
        </br>which he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had
        </br>succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights
        </br>and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her
        </br>influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most
        </br>happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.  Mary had
        </br>acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles
        </br>Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of
        </br>character, which must have placed her high with any people of real
        </br>understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no
        </br>weight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.
        </br>
        </br>To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued
        </br>god-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all; but
        </br>it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.
        </br>
        </br>A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her
        </br>bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had
        </br>found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate
        </br>features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in
        </br>them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem. He had
        </br>never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in
        </br>any other page of his favourite work.  All equality of alliance must
        </br>rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old
        </br>country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore
        </br>given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or
        </br>other, marry suitably.
        </br>
        </br>It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she
        </br>was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been
        </br>neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely
        </br>any charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome
        </br>Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter
        </br>might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be
        </br>deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming
        </br>as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he
        </br>could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance
        </br>were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the
        </br>neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about
        </br>Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.
        </br>
        </br>Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.
        </br>Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and
        </br>directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have
        </br>given the idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years
        </br>had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at
        </br>home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking
        </br>immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and
        </br>dining-rooms in the country.  Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had
        </br>seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood
        </br>afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled
        </br>up to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the
        </br>great world.  She had the remembrance of all this, she had the
        </br>consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and
        </br>some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as
        </br>handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and
        </br>would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by
        </br>baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again
        </br>take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,
        </br>but now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of her
        </br>own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,
        </br>made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it
        </br>open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and
        </br>pushed it away.
        </br>
        </br>She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially
        </br>the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.
        </br>The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose
        </br>rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed
        </br>her.
        </br>
        </br>She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,
        </br>in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to
        </br>marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.  He had not
        </br>been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir
        </br>Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not
        </br>been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making
        </br>allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their
        </br>spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr
        </br>Elliot had been forced into the introduction.
        </br>
        </br>He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the
        </br>law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his
        </br>favour was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked
        </br>of and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.  The
        </br>following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,
        </br>again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and
        </br>the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing his
        </br>fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he
        </br>had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of
        </br>inferior birth.
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter has resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that he
        </br>ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so
        </br>publicly by the hand; "For they must have been seen together," he
        </br>observed, "once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of
        </br>Commons."  His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little
        </br>regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as
        </br>unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter
        </br>considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had
        </br>ceased.
        </br>
        </br>This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of
        </br>several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for
        </br>himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong
        </br>family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter
        </br>Elliot's eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her
        </br>feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.  Yet so
        </br>miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present
        </br>time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could
        </br>not admit him to be worth thinking of again.  The disgrace of his first
        </br>marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it
        </br>perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse;
        </br>but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they
        </br>had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most
        </br>slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and
        </br>the honours which were hereafter to be his own.  This could not be
        </br>pardoned.
        </br>
        </br>Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares
        </br>to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the
        </br>prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings
        </br>to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,
        </br>to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no
        </br>talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.
        </br>
        </br>But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
        </br>added to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.  She
        </br>knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the
        </br>heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr
        </br>Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was
        </br>good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required
        </br>in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,
        </br>moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but
        </br>with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he
        </br>had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him to
        </br>spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was
        </br>imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only
        </br>growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it
        </br>became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his
        </br>daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town;
        </br>he had gone so far even as to say, "Can we retrench?  Does it occur to
        </br>you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?" and
        </br>Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,
        </br>set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed
        </br>these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,
        </br>and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which
        </br>expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no
        </br>present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these
        </br>measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real
        </br>extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged
        </br>to confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose of
        </br>deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her
        </br>father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of
        </br>lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or
        </br>relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.
        </br>
        </br>There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose
        </br>of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no
        </br>difference.  He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the
        </br>power, but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never
        </br>disgrace his name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted
        </br>whole and entire, as he had received it.
        </br>
        </br>Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the
        </br>neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;
        </br>and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
        </br>struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and
        </br>reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence
        </br>of taste or pride.
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 2
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold
        </br>or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted
        </br>by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and
        </br>only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent
        </br>judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully
        </br>expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see
        </br>finally adopted.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it
        </br>much serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of
        </br>quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this
        </br>instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.
        </br>She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;
        </br>but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous
        </br>for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was
        </br>due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.  She was a
        </br>benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,
        </br>most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with
        </br>manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.  She had a
        </br>cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;
        </br>but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for
        </br>rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those
        </br>who possessed them.  Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the
        </br>dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his
        </br>claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging
        </br>landlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and
        </br>her sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to
        </br>a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present
        </br>difficulties.
        </br>
        </br>They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was very
        </br>anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and
        </br>Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,
        </br>and she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne, who
        </br>never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the
        </br>question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in
        </br>marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to
        </br>Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of honesty
        </br>against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete
        </br>reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of
        </br>indifference for everything but justice and equity.
        </br>
        </br>"If we can persuade your father to all this," said Lady Russell,
        </br>looking over her paper, "much may be done.  If he will adopt these
        </br>regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able
        </br>to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability
        </br>in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the
        </br>true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the
        </br>eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.  What will
        </br>he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have
        </br>done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case; and
        </br>it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as
        </br>it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  We
        </br>must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has
        </br>contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the
        </br>feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,
        </br>there is still more due to the character of an honest man."
        </br>
        </br>This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be
        </br>proceeding, his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act
        </br>of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all
        </br>the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,
        </br>and saw no dignity in anything short of it.  She wanted it to be
        </br>prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated Lady Russell's influence
        </br>highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own
        </br>conscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty
        </br>in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.  Her
        </br>knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the
        </br>sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of
        </br>both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle
        </br>reductions.
        </br>
        </br>How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little
        </br>consequence.  Lady Russell's had no success at all: could not be put up
        </br>with, were not to be borne. "What! every comfort of life knocked off!
        </br>Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions and
        </br>restrictions every where!  To live no longer with the decencies even of
        </br>a private gentleman!  No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,
        </br>than remain in it on such disgraceful terms."
        </br>
        </br>"Quit Kellynch Hall."  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr
        </br>Shepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's
        </br>retrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done
        </br>without a change of abode.  "Since the idea had been started in the
        </br>very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple," he said, "in
        </br>confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not
        </br>appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of
        </br>living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient
        </br>dignity to support.  In any other place Sir Walter might judge for
        </br>himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in
        </br>whatever way he might choose to model his household."
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of
        </br>doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was
        </br>settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.
        </br>
        </br>There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in
        </br>the country.  All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.  A small house
        </br>in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell's
        </br>society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes
        </br>seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her
        </br>ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something
        </br>very opposite from her inclination fixed on.  She disliked Bath, and
        </br>did not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home.
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt
        </br>that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to
        </br>dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer
        </br>place for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important
        </br>at comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath over
        </br>London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient
        </br>distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending
        </br>some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of
        </br>Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for
        </br>Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should
        </br>lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.  It
        </br>would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in
        </br>his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found the
        </br>mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's
        </br>feelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne's
        </br>dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,
        </br>first, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school
        </br>there, after her mother's death; and secondly, from her happening to be
        </br>not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards
        </br>spent there with herself.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must
        </br>suit them all; and as to her young friend's health, by passing all the
        </br>warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;
        </br>and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits
        </br>good.  Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her spirits
        </br>were not high.  A larger society would improve them.  She wanted her to
        </br>be more known.
        </br>
        </br>The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for
        </br>Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very
        </br>material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the
        </br>beginning.  He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the
        </br>hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir
        </br>Walter's have found too much.  Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This,
        </br>however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own
        </br>circle.
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to
        </br>design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word
        </br>"advertise," but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned the
        </br>idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint
        </br>being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the
        </br>supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most
        </br>unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,
        </br>that he would let it at all.
        </br>
        </br>How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell
        </br>had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir
        </br>Walter and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had
        </br>been lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.
        </br>It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an
        </br>unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with the additional
        </br>burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman, who understood
        </br>the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;
        </br>and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been
        </br>already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady
        </br>Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of
        </br>caution and reserve.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and
        </br>seemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because
        </br>Elizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more than
        </br>outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had
        </br>never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against
        </br>previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying
        </br>to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the
        </br>injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut
        </br>her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth
        </br>the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in
        </br>vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in
        </br>more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs
        </br>Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her
        </br>affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her
        </br>but the object of distant civility.
        </br>
        </br>From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very
        </br>unequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;
        </br>and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of
        </br>more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore an
        </br>object of first-rate importance.

        </br>
        </br>Chapter 3
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter," said Mr Shepherd one
        </br>morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, "that the
        </br>present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will be turning all
        </br>our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be all wanting a home.
        </br>Could not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants,
        </br>very responsible tenants.  Many a noble fortune has been made during
        </br>the war.  If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter--"
        </br>
        </br>"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd," replied Sir Walter; "that's
        </br>all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him;
        </br>rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so many
        </br>before; hey, Shepherd?"
        </br>
        </br>Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--
        </br>
        </br>"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,
        </br>gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little
        </br>knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess
        </br>that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make
        </br>desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.
        </br>Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if
        </br>in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which
        </br>must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult
        </br>it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the
        </br>notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John
        </br>Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody
        </br>would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot
        </br>has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and
        </br>therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise
        </br>me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get
        </br>abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since
        </br>applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our
        </br>wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave
        </br>to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the
        </br>trouble of replying."
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the
        </br>room, he observed sarcastically--
        </br>
        </br>"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would
        </br>not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description."
        </br>
        </br>"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,"
        </br>said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her
        </br>over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to
        </br>Kellynch: "but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might
        </br>be a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the
        </br>profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful
        </br>in all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if
        </br>you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in and
        </br>about the house would be taken such excellent care of!  The gardens and
        </br>shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.  You
        </br>need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being
        </br>neglected."
        </br>
        </br>"As to all that," rejoined Sir Walter coolly, "supposing I were induced
        </br>to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the
        </br>privileges to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to
        </br>favour a tenant.  The park would be open to him of course, and few navy
        </br>officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range;
        </br>but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the
        </br>pleasure-grounds, is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my
        </br>shrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss
        </br>Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden.  I am very
        </br>little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary
        </br>favour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier."
        </br>
        </br>After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--
        </br>
        </br>"In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything
        </br>plain and easy between landlord and tenant.  Your interest, Sir Walter,
        </br>is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant
        </br>has more than his just rights.  I venture to hint, that Sir Walter
        </br>Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be
        </br>for him."
        </br>
        </br>Here Anne spoke--
        </br>
        </br>"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an
        </br>equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the
        </br>privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough for their
        </br>comforts, we must all allow."
        </br>
        </br>"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true," was Mr
        </br>Shepherd's rejoinder, and "Oh! certainly," was his daughter's; but Sir
        </br>Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--
        </br>
        </br>"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any
        </br>friend of mine belonging to it."
        </br>
        </br>"Indeed!" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.
        </br>
        </br>"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of
        </br>objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons of
        </br>obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which
        </br>their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it
        </br>cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old
        </br>sooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.  A man is
        </br>in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one
        </br>whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of
        </br>becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other
        </br>line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men,
        </br>striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father
        </br>we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was
        </br>to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most
        </br>deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of
        </br>mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles,
        </br>nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  'In
        </br>the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine
        </br>who was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley).  'Old fellow!' cried Sir
        </br>Basil, 'it is Admiral Baldwin.  What do you take his age to be?'
        </br>'Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.' 'Forty,' replied Sir Basil,
        </br>'forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not
        </br>easily forget Admiral Baldwin.  I never saw quite so wretched an
        </br>example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is
        </br>the same with them all:  they are all knocked about, and exposed to
        </br>every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen.  It
        </br>is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach
        </br>Admiral Baldwin's age."
        </br>
        </br>"Nay, Sir Walter," cried Mrs Clay, "this is being severe indeed.  Have
        </br>a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.
        </br>The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I
        </br>have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then, is not
        </br>it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?  Soldiers,
        </br>in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in the quieter
        </br>professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the
        </br>body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time.
        </br>The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours,
        </br>and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--" she stopt a
        </br>moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--"and even the
        </br>clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose
        </br>his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In
        </br>fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is
        </br>necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who
        </br>are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the
        </br>country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and
        </br>living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more;
        </br>it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good
        </br>appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose
        </br>something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young."
        </br>
        </br>It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter's
        </br>good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with
        </br>foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an
        </br>Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in
        </br>attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received
        </br>a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.  By the report which
        </br>he hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of
        </br>Somersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing
        </br>to settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to
        </br>look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which,
        </br>however, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as
        </br>he had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not
        </br>be kept a secret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility of
        </br>Kellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's)
        </br>connection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to
        </br>make particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long
        </br>conference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man
        </br>who knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in
        </br>his explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a most
        </br>responsible, eligible tenant.
        </br>
        </br>"And who is Admiral Croft?" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.
        </br>
        </br>Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family, and
        </br>mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,
        </br>added--
        </br>
        </br>"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,
        </br>and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I
        </br>believe, several years."
        </br>
        </br>"Then I take it for granted," observed Sir Walter, "that his face is
        </br>about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery."
        </br>
        </br>Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,
        </br>hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not
        </br>much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not
        </br>likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a
        </br>comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must
        </br>pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that
        </br>consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter
        </br>had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the
        </br>deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes
        </br>took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.
        </br>
        </br>Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the
        </br>circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him peculiarly
        </br>desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man, and without children; the
        </br>very state to be wished for.  A house was never taken good care of, Mr
        </br>Shepherd observed, without a lady: he did not know, whether furniture
        </br>might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, as
        </br>where there were many children.  A lady, without a family, was the very
        </br>best preserver of furniture in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too;
        </br>she was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all
        </br>the time they were talking the matter over.
        </br>
        </br>"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,"
        </br>continued he; "asked more questions about the house, and terms, and
        </br>taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with
        </br>business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite
        </br>unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,
        </br>she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me
        </br>so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at
        </br>Monkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannot
        </br>recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, my
        </br>dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at
        </br>Monkford: Mrs Croft's brother?"
        </br>
        </br>But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not
        </br>hear the appeal.
        </br>
        </br>"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no
        </br>gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent."
        </br>
        </br>"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.
        </br>A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so
        </br>well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, I
        </br>remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man
        </br>breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the
        </br>fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an
        </br>amicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!"
        </br>
        </br>After waiting another moment--
        </br>
        </br>"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?" said Anne.
        </br>
        </br>Mr Shepherd was all gratitude.
        </br>
        </br>"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.  He had
        </br>the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two
        </br>or three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.  You
        </br>remember him, I am sure."
        </br>
        </br>"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.  You misled
        </br>me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of some man of
        </br>property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected;
        </br>nothing to do with the Strafford family.  One wonders how the names of
        </br>many of our nobility become so common."
        </br>
        </br>As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no
        </br>service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning, with all
        </br>his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their
        </br>favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had
        </br>formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of
        </br>renting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the
        </br>happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary
        </br>taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir
        </br>Walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.
        </br>
        </br>It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an
        </br>evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them
        </br>infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest
        </br>terms, he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the
        </br>treaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still
        </br>remained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough of the
        </br>world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials,
        </br>than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.  So far went his
        </br>understanding; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in
        </br>the Admiral's situation in life, which was just high enough, and not
        </br>too high.  "I have let my house to Admiral Croft," would sound
        </br>extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--; a Mr (save,
        </br>perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of
        </br>explanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence, and, at the same
        </br>time, can never make a baronet look small.  In all their dealings and
        </br>intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence.
        </br>
        </br>Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her
        </br>inclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she was happy to
        </br>have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to
        </br>suspend decision was uttered by her.
        </br>
        </br>Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an
        </br>end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener to
        </br>the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her
        </br>flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with a
        </br>gentle sigh, "A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here."
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 4
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however
        </br>suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his
        </br>brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St
        </br>Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in
        </br>the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half
        </br>a year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man,
        </br>with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an
        </br>extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.
        </br>Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for
        </br>he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love; but the
        </br>encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.  They were
        </br>gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.
        </br>It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the
        </br>other, or which had been the happiest: she, in receiving his
        </br>declarations and proposals, or he in having them accepted.
        </br>
        </br>A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.
        </br>Troubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually
        </br>withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the
        </br>negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a
        </br>professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.  He thought it
        </br>a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more tempered
        </br>and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.
        </br>
        </br>Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw
        </br>herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement
        </br>with a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and no
        </br>hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain
        </br>profession, and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the
        </br>profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she grieved to
        </br>think of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off
        </br>by a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him into a
        </br>state of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence!  It must not
        </br>be, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from
        </br>one who had almost a mother's love, and mother's rights, it would be
        </br>prevented.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;
        </br>but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.  But
        </br>he was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour,
        </br>he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that
        </br>would lead to everything he wanted.  He had always been lucky; he knew
        </br>he should be so still.  Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth,
        </br>and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been
        </br>enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His
        </br>sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on
        </br>her.  She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a
        </br>dangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.
        </br>Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to
        </br>imprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.
        </br>
        </br>Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could
        </br>combat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possible
        </br>to withstand her father's ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word
        </br>or look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had
        </br>always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion,
        </br>and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain.
        </br>She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet,
        </br>improper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it.  But it was
        </br>not a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an end
        </br>to it.  Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even more
        </br>than her own, she could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being
        </br>prudent, and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief
        </br>consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every
        </br>consolation was required, for she had to encounter all the additional
        </br>pain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and
        </br>of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had
        </br>left the country in consequence.
        </br>
        </br>A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;
        </br>but not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it.  Her
        </br>attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of
        </br>youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting
        </br>effect.
        </br>
        </br>More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful
        </br>interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much,
        </br>perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been too
        </br>dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place
        </br>(except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty
        </br>or enlargement of society.  No one had ever come within the Kellynch
        </br>circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he
        </br>stood in her memory.  No second attachment, the only thoroughly
        </br>natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been
        </br>possible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste,
        </br>in the small limits of the society around them.  She had been
        </br>solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young
        </br>man, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger
        </br>sister; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove
        </br>was the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general
        </br>importance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter's, and of
        </br>good character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have
        </br>asked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she would have
        </br>rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the
        </br>partialities and injustice of her father's house, and settled so
        </br>permanently near herself.  But in this case, Anne had left nothing for
        </br>advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her
        </br>own discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the
        </br>anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some
        </br>man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held
        </br>her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.
        </br>
        </br>They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,
        </br>on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never
        </br>alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently
        </br>from what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame
        </br>Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;
        </br>but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to
        </br>apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain
        </br>immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.  She was persuaded
        </br>that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every
        </br>anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and
        </br>disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in
        </br>maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;
        </br>and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than
        </br>the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,
        </br>without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it
        </br>happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be
        </br>reasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations, all his
        </br>confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour had seemed to
        </br>foresee and to command his prosperous path.  He had, very soon after
        </br>their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her would
        </br>follow, had taken place.  He had distinguished himself, and early
        </br>gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures,
        </br>have made a handsome fortune.  She had only navy lists and newspapers
        </br>for her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in
        </br>favour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.
        </br>
        </br>How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least, were
        </br>her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful
        </br>confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems
        </br>to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced into
        </br>prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the
        </br>natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.
        </br>
        </br>With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not
        </br>hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynch
        </br>without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh,
        </br>were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.  She often told
        </br>herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently
        </br>to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no
        </br>evil.  She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and
        </br>apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in
        </br>the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of
        </br>it.  She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives
        </br>in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all
        </br>the better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion
        </br>among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the
        </br>event of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew
        </br>over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the
        </br>past being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no
        </br>syllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that
        </br>among his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had
        </br>received any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother
        </br>had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and,
        </br>moreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no
        </br>human creature's having heard of it from him.
        </br>
        </br>The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her
        </br>husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary, had been at
        </br>school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some,
        </br>and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.
        </br>
        </br>With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself
        </br>and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,
        </br>and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not
        </br>involve any particular awkwardness.
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 5
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch
        </br>Hall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady
        </br>Russell's, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it
        </br>most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing
        </br>them.
        </br>
        </br>This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided
        </br>the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously well disposed for
        </br>an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the
        </br>other; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good
        </br>humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral's side, as
        </br>could not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into
        </br>his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances
        </br>of his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good
        </br>breeding.
        </br>
        </br>The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were
        </br>approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr
        </br>Shepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been a single
        </br>preliminary difference to modify of all that "This indenture sheweth."
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the
        </br>best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,
        </br>that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should
        </br>not be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with
        </br>sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through
        </br>the park, "I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite
        </br>of what they told us at Taunton.  The Baronet will never set the Thames
        </br>on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him."--reciprocal
        </br>compliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.
        </br>
        </br>The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter
        </br>proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there
        </br>was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any
        </br>use, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were
        </br>going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,
        </br>and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might
        </br>convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of
        </br>her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was
        </br>unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne though dreading
        </br>the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and
        </br>grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the
        </br>autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything
        </br>considered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right, and most
        </br>wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.
        </br>
        </br>Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.  Mary, often
        </br>a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own
        </br>complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was
        </br>the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a
        </br>day's health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it
        </br>was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her
        </br>company as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath.
        </br>
        </br>"I cannot possibly do without Anne," was Mary's reasoning; and
        </br>Elizabeth's reply was, "Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody
        </br>will want her in Bath."
        </br>
        </br>To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least
        </br>better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be
        </br>thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and
        </br>certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own
        </br>dear country, readily agreed to stay.
        </br>
        </br>This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties, and
        </br>it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till
        </br>Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be
        </br>divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.
        </br>
        </br>So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by
        </br>the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,
        </br>which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and
        </br>Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in
        </br>all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry that
        </br>such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved,
        </br>and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay's being
        </br>of so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore
        </br>aggravation.
        </br>
        </br>Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the
        </br>imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.  With a
        </br>great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often
        </br>wished less, of her father's character, she was sensible that results
        </br>the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than
        </br>possible.  She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea
        </br>of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a
        </br>clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in
        </br>her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking,
        </br>and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners,
        </br>infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might
        </br>have been.  Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that
        </br>she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her
        </br>sister.  She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the
        </br>event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than
        </br>herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for
        </br>giving no warning.
        </br>
        </br>She spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive how
        </br>such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered
        </br>for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.
        </br>
        </br>"Mrs Clay," said she, warmly, "never forgets who she is; and as I am
        </br>rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can
        </br>assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly
        </br>nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more
        </br>strongly than most people.  And as to my father, I really should not
        </br>have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our
        </br>sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman,
        </br>I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that
        </br>anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a
        </br>degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay
        </br>who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably
        </br>pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect
        </br>safety.  One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her
        </br>personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth
        </br>of her's and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much
        </br>as they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a
        </br>few, but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay's
        </br>freckles."
        </br>
        </br>"There is hardly any personal defect," replied Anne, "which an
        </br>agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to."
        </br>
        </br>"I think very differently," answered Elizabeth, shortly; "an agreeable
        </br>manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.
        </br>However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this
        </br>point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you
        </br>to be advising me."
        </br>
        </br>Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of
        </br>doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be
        </br>made observant by it.
        </br>
        </br>The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,
        </br>Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very good
        </br>spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the
        </br>afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show
        </br>themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate
        </br>tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.
        </br>
        </br>Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt
        </br>this break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was as
        </br>dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by
        </br>habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still
        </br>worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape
        </br>the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out
        </br>of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she had determined
        </br>to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne.
        </br>Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at
        </br>Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.
        </br>
        </br>Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had
        </br>been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses
        </br>superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the
        </br>mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,
        </br>substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,
        </br>enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained
        </br>round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had
        </br>received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for
        </br>his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French
        </br>windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the
        </br>traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and
        </br>premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.
        </br>
        </br>Here Anne had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross as
        </br>well as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually
        </br>meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's
        </br>house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary
        </br>alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost
        </br>a matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary
        </br>had not Anne's understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and
        </br>properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;
        </br>but any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for
        </br>solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot
        </br>self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of
        </br>fancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior to
        </br>both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of
        </br>being "a fine girl." She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty
        </br>little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been
        </br>gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two
        </br>children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--
        </br>
        </br>"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.  I
        </br>am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature the whole
        </br>morning!"
        </br>
        </br>"I am sorry to find you unwell," replied Anne.  "You sent me such a
        </br>good account of yourself on Thursday!"
        </br>
        </br>"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well
        </br>at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have
        </br>been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.
        </br>Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not
        </br>able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.  I do not
        </br>think she has been in this house three times this summer."
        </br>
        </br>Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.  "Oh!
        </br>Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o'clock.  He
        </br>would go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not stay
        </br>out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.  I
        </br>assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning."
        </br>
        </br>"You have had your little boys with you?"
        </br>
        </br>"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable
        </br>that they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind a
        </br>word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad."
        </br>
        </br>"Well, you will soon be better now," replied Anne, cheerfully.  "You
        </br>know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours at the
        </br>Great House?"
        </br>
        </br>"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them
        </br>to-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the
        </br>window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how
        </br>ill I was, not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to
        </br>suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out
        </br>of their way."
        </br>
        </br>"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.  It is
        </br>early."
        </br>
        </br>"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal too
        </br>much for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind of
        </br>you not to come on Thursday."
        </br>
        </br>"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of
        </br>yourself!  You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were
        </br>perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you
        </br>must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the
        </br>last: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so
        </br>busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have
        </br>left Kellynch sooner."
        </br>
        </br>"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?"
        </br>
        </br>"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect in a
        </br>moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making a duplicate of the
        </br>catalogue of my father's books and pictures.  I have been several times
        </br>in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him
        </br>understand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell.  I have
        </br>had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide,
        </br>and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what
        </br>was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary,
        </br>of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as
        </br>a sort of take-leave.  I was told that they wished it.  But all these
        </br>things took up a great deal of time."
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! well!" and after a moment's pause, "but you have never asked me
        </br>one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday."
        </br>
        </br>"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you
        </br>must have been obliged to give up the party."
        </br>
        </br>"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter
        </br>with me till this morning.  It would have been strange if I had not
        </br>gone."
        </br>
        </br>"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant
        </br>party."
        </br>
        </br>"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will
        </br>be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a
        </br>carriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so
        </br>crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr
        </br>Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into the back
        </br>seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely that my
        </br>illness to-day may be owing to it."
        </br>
        </br>A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on
        </br>Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.  She could soon sit
        </br>upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by
        </br>dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other end
        </br>of the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; and
        </br>then she was well enough to propose a little walk.
        </br>
        </br>"Where shall we go?" said she, when they were ready.  "I suppose you
        </br>will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see
        </br>you?"
        </br>
        </br>"I have not the smallest objection on that account," replied Anne.  "I
        </br>should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so
        </br>well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves."
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.  They ought
        </br>to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However, we may as well go
        </br>and sit with them a little  while, and when we have that over, we can
        </br>enjoy our walk."
        </br>
        </br>Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;
        </br>but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,
        </br>though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither
        </br>family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly they
        </br>went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,
        </br>with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters
        </br>of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a
        </br>grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in
        </br>every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the
        </br>wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue
        </br>satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an
        </br>overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves seemed
        </br>to be staring in astonishment.
        </br>
        </br>The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,
        </br>perhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old English
        </br>style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a
        </br>very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated,
        </br>and not at all elegant.  Their children had more modern minds and
        </br>manners.  There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up,
        </br>excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen
        </br>and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock
        </br>of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,
        </br>living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.  Their dress had every
        </br>advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely
        </br>good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence
        </br>at home, and favourites abroad.  Anne always contemplated them as some
        </br>of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we
        </br>all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for
        </br>the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more
        </br>elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them
        </br>nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement
        </br>together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known
        </br>so little herself with either of her sisters.
        </br>
        </br>They were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss on the
        </br>side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well
        </br>knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was chatted away pleasantly
        </br>enough; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it, to have
        </br>their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's
        </br>particular invitation.
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 6
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal
        </br>from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three
        </br>miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and
        </br>idea.  She had never been staying there before, without being struck by
        </br>it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in
        </br>seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at
        </br>Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading
        </br>interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now
        </br>submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own
        </br>nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; for
        </br>certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which
        </br>had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,
        </br>she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in
        </br>the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: "So, Miss
        </br>Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you
        </br>think they will settle in?" and this, without much waiting for an
        </br>answer; or in the young ladies' addition of, "I hope we shall be in
        </br>Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a
        </br>good situation:  none of your Queen Squares for us!" or in the anxious
        </br>supplement from Mary, of--"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off,
        </br>when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!"
        </br>
        </br>She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think
        </br>with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one
        </br>such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.
        </br>
        </br>The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own
        </br>horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully
        </br>occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours,
        </br>dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be very fitting,
        </br>that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of
        </br>discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the
        </br>one she was now transplanted into.  With the prospect of spending at
        </br>least two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her to
        </br>clothe her imagination, her memory, and all her ideas in as much of
        </br>Uppercross as possible.
        </br>
        </br>She had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive and
        </br>unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;
        </br>neither was there anything among the other component parts of the
        </br>cottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms with her
        </br>brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and
        </br>respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of
        </br>interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.
        </br>
        </br>Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was
        </br>undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,
        </br>or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a
        </br>dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe,
        </br>with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved
        </br>him; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more
        </br>consequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and
        </br>elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was, he did nothing with
        </br>much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without
        </br>benefit from books or anything else.  He had very good spirits, which
        </br>never seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness, bore with
        </br>her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the
        </br>whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she
        </br>had sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both
        </br>parties), they might pass for a happy couple.  They were always
        </br>perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination
        </br>for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he
        </br>had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such
        </br>a present was not made, he always contended for his father's having
        </br>many other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.
        </br>
        </br>As to the management of their children, his theory was much better than
        </br>his wife's, and his practice not so bad.  "I could manage them very
        </br>well, if it were not for Mary's interference," was what Anne often
        </br>heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in
        </br>turn to Mary's reproach of "Charles spoils the children so that I
        </br>cannot get them into any order," she never had the smallest temptation
        </br>to say, "Very true."
        </br>
        </br>One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her
        </br>being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too
        </br>much in the secret of the complaints of each house.  Known to have some
        </br>influence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least
        </br>receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.  "I wish you
        </br>could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill," was
        </br>Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: "I do
        </br>believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there was
        </br>anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might
        </br>persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever
        </br>own."
        </br>
        </br>Mary's declaration was, "I hate sending the children to the Great
        </br>House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she
        </br>humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much
        </br>trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross
        </br>for the rest of the day."  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity
        </br>of being alone with Anne, to say, "Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing
        </br>Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.  They are
        </br>quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure, in general they
        </br>are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of
        </br>managing them.  They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen,
        </br>poor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more
        </br>how they should be treated--!  Bless me! how troublesome they are
        </br>sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them
        </br>at our house so often as I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is
        </br>not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is
        </br>very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
        </br>every moment; "don't do this," and "don't do that;" or that one can
        </br>only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them."
        </br>
        </br>She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  "Mrs Musgrove thinks
        </br>all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in
        </br>question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper
        </br>house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are
        </br>gadding about the village, all day long.  I meet them wherever I go;
        </br>and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing
        </br>something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest
        </br>creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells
        </br>me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them." And on Mrs
        </br>Musgrove's side, it was, "I make a rule of never interfering in any of
        </br>my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall
        </br>tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights,
        </br>that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hear
        </br>strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own
        </br>knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is
        </br>enough to ruin any servants she comes near.  Mrs Charles quite swears
        </br>by her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the
        </br>watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of
        </br>mentioning it."
        </br>
        </br>Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to
        </br>give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great
        </br>House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was
        </br>to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.  And one day
        </br>when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after
        </br>talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, "I have no
        </br>scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about
        </br>their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you
        </br>are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would
        </br>be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if
        </br>she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.
        </br>Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be
        </br>more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.  It is not that
        </br>mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken
        </br>notice of by many persons."
        </br>
        </br>How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little
        </br>more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to
        </br>the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between
        </br>such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant
        </br>for her sister's benefit.
        </br>
        </br>In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.  Her
        </br>own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed
        </br>three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a
        </br>constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family,
        </br>since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment
        </br>in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.  It
        </br>was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every
        </br>morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed
        </br>they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs
        </br>Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the
        </br>talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.
        </br>
        </br>She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but
        </br>having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit
        </br>by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought
        </br>of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well
        </br>aware.  She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to
        </br>herself; but this was no new sensation.  Excepting one short period of
        </br>her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the
        </br>loss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or
        </br>encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.  In music she had
        </br>been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's
        </br>fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total
        </br>indifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for
        </br>their sakes, than mortification for her own.
        </br>
        </br>The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.
        </br>The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by
        </br>everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors
        </br>by invitation and by chance, than any other family.  There were more
        </br>completely popular.
        </br>
        </br>The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,
        </br>in an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins within
        </br>a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on
        </br>the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come at any time,
        </br>and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much
        </br>preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country
        </br>dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always
        </br>recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove
        </br>more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--"Well done,
        </br>Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!  how those little
        </br>fingers of yours fly about!"
        </br>
        </br>So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart
        </br>must be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others; all the
        </br>precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own
        </br>other eyes and other limbs!  She could not think of much else on the
        </br>29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening
        </br>from Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month,
        </br>exclaimed, "Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to
        </br>Kellynch?  I am glad I did not think of it before.  How low it makes
        </br>me!"
        </br>
        </br>The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be
        </br>visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.  "Nobody knew how
        </br>much she should suffer.  She should put it off as long as she could;"
        </br>but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on
        </br>an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of
        </br>imaginary agitation, when she came back.  Anne had very sincerely
        </br>rejoiced in there being no means of her going.  She wished, however to
        </br>see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.
        </br>They came:  the master of the house was not at home, but the two
        </br>sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the
        </br>share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very
        </br>agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well
        </br>able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to
        </br>catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.
        </br>
        </br>Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness,
        </br>and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.  She had
        </br>bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though
        </br>her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her
        </br>having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have
        </br>lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.
        </br>Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust
        </br>of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to
        </br>coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.  Anne gave her credit,
        </br>indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all
        </br>that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had
        </br>satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of
        </br>introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge
        </br>or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.  She was
        </br>quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage,
        </br>till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--
        </br>
        </br>"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the
        </br>pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country."
        </br>
        </br>Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion
        </br>she certainly had not.
        </br>
        </br>"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?" added Mrs Croft.
        </br>
        </br>She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs
        </br>Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke,
        </br>that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother. She
        </br>immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be
        </br>thinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame
        </br>at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their
        </br>former neighbour's present state with proper interest.
        </br>
        </br>The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she
        </br>heard the Admiral say to Mary--
        </br>
        </br>"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you
        </br>know him by name."
        </br>
        </br>He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to
        </br>him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too
        </br>much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets,
        </br>&c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had
        </br>begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that
        </br>the same brother must still be in question.  She could not, however,
        </br>reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether
        </br>anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the
        </br>Crofts had previously been calling.
        </br>
        </br>The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at
        </br>the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to
        </br>be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the
        </br>youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming to apologize,
        </br>and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the
        </br>first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa
        </br>made all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more
        </br>room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.
        </br>
        </br>"And I will tell you our reason," she added, "and all about it.  I am
        </br>come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this
        </br>evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard!
        </br>And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse
        </br>her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you why she is out of
        </br>spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here
        </br>afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother,
        </br>Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or
        </br>something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most
        </br>unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that
        </br>Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's
        </br>captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while
        </br>before he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over his letters and
        </br>things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be
        </br>the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!
        </br>So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon
        </br>such gloomy things."
        </br>
        </br>The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,
        </br>that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,
        </br>hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his
        </br>twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and
        </br>unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any
        </br>time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard
        </br>of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death
        </br>abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.
        </br>
        </br>He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for
        </br>him, by calling him "poor Richard," been nothing better than a
        </br>thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done
        </br>anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,
        </br>living or dead.
        </br>
        </br>He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those
        </br>removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such
        </br>midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on
        </br>board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the
        </br>Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only
        </br>two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him
        </br>during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two
        </br>disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for
        </br>money.
        </br>
        </br>In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little
        </br>were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and
        </br>incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made
        </br>scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have
        </br>been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of
        </br>Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary
        </br>bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.
        </br>
        </br>She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the
        </br>re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son
        </br>gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had
        </br>affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for
        </br>him than she had known on first hearing of his death.  Mr Musgrove was,
        </br>in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the
        </br>cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew
        </br>on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful
        </br>companions could give them.
        </br>
        </br>To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name
        </br>so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it
        </br>might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain
        </br>Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their
        </br>coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say
        </br>whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to
        </br>Anne's nerves.  She found, however, that it was one to which she must
        </br>inure herself.  Since he actually was expected in the country, she must
        </br>teach herself to be insensible on such points.  And not only did it
        </br>appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their
        </br>warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high
        </br>respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been
        </br>six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not
        </br>perfectly well-spelt praise, as "a fine dashing felow, only two
        </br>perticular about the schoolmaster," were bent on introducing
        </br>themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of
        </br>his arrival.
        </br>
        </br>The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.
        </br>

        </br>
        </br>Chapter 7
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at
        </br>Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his
        </br>praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by
        </br>the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment to Mr
        </br>Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was
        </br>he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own
        </br>roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his
        </br>cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne's reckoning, and
        </br>then, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she
        </br>could feel secure even for a week.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,
        </br>and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.  She and Mary
        </br>were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she
        </br>afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were
        </br>stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in
        </br>consequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation put the visit
        </br>entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference,
        </br>even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on
        </br>his account.
        </br>
        </br>His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in
        </br>the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.  It was an afternoon of
        </br>distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to
        </br>send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to
        </br>support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest
        </br>child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe;
        </br>besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the
        </br>other house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened,
        </br>enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.
        </br>
        </br>Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care of
        </br>his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.
        </br>Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the
        </br>worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;
        </br>but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt
        </br>and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the
        </br>father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be
        </br>able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then
        </br>it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so
        </br>far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of
        </br>Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father and
        </br>mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with
        </br>him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him
        </br>than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all
        </br>a favourite before.  How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to
        </br>stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and
        </br>how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's
        </br>farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the
        </br>morrow--actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a
        </br>manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he
        </br>ought.  And in short, he had looked and said everything with such
        </br>exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both
        </br>turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and
        </br>apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.
        </br>
        </br>The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls
        </br>came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make
        </br>enquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about
        </br>his heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would
        </br>be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry
        </br>to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the
        </br>little boy, to give him the meeting.  "Oh no; as to leaving the little
        </br>boy," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
        </br>to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help
        </br>adding her warm protestations to theirs.
        </br>
        </br>Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; "the
        </br>child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to
        </br>Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he
        </br>would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour." But
        </br>in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with "Oh! no, indeed,
        </br>Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything
        </br>should happen?"
        </br>
        </br>The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.  It
        </br>must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the
        </br>spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles
        </br>Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer
        </br>confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as
        </br>possible; but what was there for a father to do?  This was quite a
        </br>female case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of no
        </br>use at home, to shut himself up.  His father very much wished him to
        </br>meet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against
        </br>it, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, public
        </br>declaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dress
        </br>directly, and dine at the other house.
        </br>
        </br>"Nothing can be going on better than the child," said he; "so I told my
        </br>father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right.
        </br>Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.  You
        </br>would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.
        </br>Anne will send for me if anything is the matter."
        </br>
        </br>Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.
        </br>Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was quite
        </br>determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.  She
        </br>said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as
        </br>there was only Anne to hear--
        </br>
        </br>"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick
        </br>child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!  I knew how
        </br>it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is anything
        </br>disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles
        </br>is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say it is very
        </br>unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.  Talks of
        </br>his being going on so well!  How does he know that he is going on well,
        </br>or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?  I did not
        </br>think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to go away
        </br>and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be
        </br>allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else
        </br>to be about the child.  My being the mother is the very reason why my
        </br>feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all equal to it.  You saw
        </br>how hysterical I was yesterday."
        </br>
        </br>"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the
        </br>shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have
        </br>nothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's
        </br>directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at
        </br>your husband.  Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his
        </br>province.  A sick child is always the mother's property:  her own
        </br>feelings generally make it so."
        </br>
        </br>"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that
        </br>I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be
        </br>always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw,
        </br>this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin
        </br>kicking about.  I have not nerves for the sort of thing."
        </br>
        </br>"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole
        </br>evening away from the poor boy?"
        </br>
        </br>"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so
        </br>careful; and she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really
        </br>think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.  I
        </br>am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.  I was
        </br>dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day."
        </br>
        </br>"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,
        </br>suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles
        </br>to my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain
        </br>with him."
        </br>
        </br>"Are you serious?" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  "Dear me!  that's
        </br>a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure, I may just as well
        </br>go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?  and it only harasses me.
        </br>You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest
        </br>person.  You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds you
        </br>at a word.  It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with
        </br>Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as
        </br>much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with
        </br>Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.  An
        </br>excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles,
        </br>and get ready directly.  You can send for us, you know, at a moment's
        </br>notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing
        </br>to alarm you.  I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel
        </br>quite at ease about my dear child."
        </br>
        </br>The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door,
        </br>and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for the whole
        </br>conversation, which began with Mary's saying, in a tone of great
        </br>exultation--
        </br>
        </br>"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than
        </br>you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should
        </br>not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.  Anne will
        </br>stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.  It is
        </br>Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great
        </br>deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday."
        </br>
        </br>"This is very kind of Anne," was her husband's answer, "and I should be
        </br>very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be
        </br>left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child."
        </br>
        </br>Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of her
        </br>manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was at
        </br>least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being left
        </br>to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,
        </br>when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to
        </br>let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and this
        </br>being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off
        </br>together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped, to be happy,
        </br>however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself,
        </br>she was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever
        </br>likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be of the first utility to the
        </br>child; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a
        </br>mile distant, making himself agreeable to others?
        </br>
        </br>She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.  Perhaps
        </br>indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.  He
        </br>must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished ever to see her
        </br>again, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done what
        </br>she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long
        </br>ago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alone
        </br>had been wanting.
        </br>
        </br>Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,
        </br>and their visit in general.  There had been music, singing, talking,
        </br>laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain
        </br>Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other
        </br>perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with
        </br>Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though
        </br>that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come
        </br>to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs
        </br>Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,
        </br>somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him
        </br>to breakfast at his father's.
        </br>
        </br>Anne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired
        </br>after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight
        </br>acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged,
        </br>actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they
        </br>were to meet.
        </br>
        </br>The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the
        </br>other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary
        </br>and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to
        </br>say that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs,
        </br>that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his sisters
        </br>meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing
        </br>also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though
        </br>Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state as could
        </br>make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without
        </br>his running on to give notice.
        </br>
        </br>Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive
        </br>him, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the
        </br>most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.  In
        </br>two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared; they were
        </br>in the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a
        </br>curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that
        </br>was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy
        </br>footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few
        </br>minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready,
        </br>their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,
        </br>suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the
        </br>sportsmen:  the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfast
        </br>as she could.
        </br>
        </br>"It is over! it is over!" she repeated to herself again and again, in
        </br>nervous gratitude.  "The worst is over!"
        </br>
        </br>Mary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.  They had
        </br>met.  They had been once more in the same room.
        </br>
        </br>Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling
        </br>less.  Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been
        </br>given up.  How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an
        </br>interval had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not
        </br>eight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,
        </br>removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--
        </br>how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part of her
        </br>own life.
        </br>
        </br>Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings
        </br>eight years may be little more than nothing.
        </br>
        </br>Now, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like wishing to
        </br>avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly
        </br>which asked the question.
        </br>
        </br>On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have
        </br>prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss
        </br>Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had
        </br>this spontaneous information from Mary:--
        </br>
        </br>"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was so
        </br>attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they
        </br>went away, and he said, 'You were so altered he should not have known
        </br>you again.'"
        </br>
        </br>Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way,
        </br>but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar
        </br>wound.
        </br>
        </br>"Altered beyond his knowledge."  Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep
        </br>mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for
        </br>he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already acknowledged
        </br>it to herself, and she could not think differently, let him think of
        </br>her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed her youth and
        </br>bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in no
        </br>respect lessening his personal advantages.  She had seen the same
        </br>Frederick Wentworth.
        </br>
        </br>"So altered that he should not have known her again!"  These were words
        </br>which could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice that
        </br>she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency; they allayed
        </br>agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier.
        </br>
        </br>Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but
        </br>without an idea that they would be carried round to her.  He had
        </br>thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had
        </br>spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.  She had used him
        </br>ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a
        </br>feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident
        </br>temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.  It
        </br>had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been weakness and
        </br>timidity.
        </br>
        </br>He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman
        </br>since whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural
        </br>sensation of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her
        </br>power with him was gone for ever.
        </br>
        </br>It was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on
        </br>shore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly
        </br>tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the
        </br>speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart
        </br>for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in
        </br>short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Anne
        </br>Elliot.  This was his only secret exception, when he said to his
        </br>sister, in answer to her suppositions:--
        </br>
        </br>"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.  Anybody
        </br>between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.  A little beauty,
        </br>and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost
        </br>man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society
        </br>among women to make him nice?"
        </br>
        </br>He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye spoke
        </br>the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his
        </br>thoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to
        </br>meet with.  "A strong mind, with sweetness of manner," made the first
        </br>and the last of the description.
        </br>
        </br>"That is the woman I want," said he.  "Something a little inferior I
        </br>shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,
        </br>I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than
        </br>most men."
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 8
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the
        </br>same circle.  They were soon dining in company together at Mr
        </br>Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer supply his aunt
        </br>with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning
        </br>of other dinings and other meetings.
        </br>
        </br>Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the
        </br>proof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of
        </br>each; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement
        </br>could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions
        </br>which conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him, his
        </br>disposition lead him, to talk; and "That was in the year six;" "That
        </br>happened before I went to sea in the year six," occurred in the course
        </br>of the first evening they spent together: and though his voice did not
        </br>falter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering
        </br>towards her while he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her
        </br>knowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance any
        </br>more than herself.  There must be the same immediate association of
        </br>thought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.
        </br>
        </br>They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the
        </br>commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!  Now nothing!
        </br>There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the
        </br>drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to
        </br>cease to speak to one another.  With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral
        </br>and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could
        </br>allow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could
        </br>have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so
        </br>in unison, no countenances so beloved.  Now they were as strangers;
        </br>nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted.  It
        </br>was a perpetual estrangement.
        </br>
        </br>When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.
        </br>There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the
        </br>party; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss
        </br>Musgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the
        </br>manner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and
        </br>their surprise at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation
        </br>and arrangement which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant
        </br>ridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been
        </br>ignorant, and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be
        </br>living on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if
        </br>there were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.
        </br>
        </br>From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper of Mrs
        </br>Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--
        </br>
        </br>"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare
        </br>say he would have been just such another by this time."
        </br>
        </br>Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove
        </br>relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,
        </br>could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.
        </br>
        </br>When she could let her attention take its natural course again, she
        </br>found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List (their own navy
        </br>list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting down
        </br>together to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the
        </br>ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.
        </br>
        </br>"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp."
        </br>
        </br>"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.  I was the
        </br>last man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.  Reported fit
        </br>for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West
        </br>Indies."
        </br>
        </br>The girls looked all amazement.
        </br>
        </br>"The Admiralty," he continued, "entertain themselves now and then, with
        </br>sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.
        </br>But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that
        </br>may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to
        </br>distinguish the very set who may be least missed."
        </br>
        </br>"Phoo! phoo!" cried the Admiral, "what stuff these young fellows talk!
        </br>Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built
        </br>sloop, you would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows
        </br>there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at
        </br>the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more
        </br>interest than his."
        </br>
        </br>"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;" replied Captain Wentworth,
        </br>seriously.  "I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can
        </br>desire.  It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a
        </br>very great object, I wanted to be doing something."
        </br>
        </br>"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore for
        </br>half a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be
        </br>afloat again."
        </br>
        </br>"But, Captain Wentworth," cried Louisa, "how vexed you must have been
        </br>when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you."
        </br>
        </br>"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;" said he, smiling.
        </br>"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the
        </br>fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about
        </br>among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which
        </br>at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.  Ah! she was a dear
        </br>old Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.  I knew she would.  I knew
        </br>that we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be
        </br>the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time
        </br>I was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very
        </br>entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn,
        </br>to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted.  I brought her into
        </br>Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.  We had not been six hours
        </br>in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights,
        </br>and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch
        </br>with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.
        </br>Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant
        </br>Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the
        </br>newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought
        </br>about me." Anne's shudderings were to herself alone; but the Miss
        </br>Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations
        </br>of pity and horror.
        </br>
        </br>"And so then, I suppose," said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as if
        </br>thinking aloud, "so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met
        </br>with our poor boy. Charles, my dear," (beckoning him to her), "do ask
        </br>Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.  I
        </br>always forgot."
        </br>
        </br>"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at
        </br>Gibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain
        </br>Wentworth."
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of
        </br>mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to
        </br>hear him talked of by such a good friend."
        </br>
        </br>Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,
        </br>only nodded in reply, and walked away.
        </br>
        </br>The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could
        </br>not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his
        </br>own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little
        </br>statement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class,
        </br>observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man
        </br>ever had.
        </br>
        </br>"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I made
        </br>money in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together
        </br>off the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!  You know how much he
        </br>wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.  Excellent fellow.  I
        </br>shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all, so much for her
        </br>sake.  I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the
        </br>same luck in the Mediterranean."
        </br>
        </br>"And I am sure, Sir," said Mrs Musgrove, "it was a lucky day for us,
        </br>when you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget what
        </br>you did."
        </br>
        </br>Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in
        </br>part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts,
        </br>looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.
        </br>
        </br>"My brother," whispered one of the girls; "mamma is thinking of poor
        </br>Richard."
        </br>
        </br>"Poor dear fellow!" continued Mrs Musgrove; "he was grown so steady,
        </br>and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!  Ah!
        </br>it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.  I assure
        </br>you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you."
        </br>
        </br>There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this
        </br>speech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome
        </br>mouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's
        </br>kind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get
        </br>rid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to
        </br>be detected by any who understood him less than herself; in another
        </br>moment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly
        </br>afterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were
        </br>sitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with
        </br>her, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and
        </br>natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was
        </br>real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.
        </br>
        </br>They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily
        </br>made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.  It was no
        </br>insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable,
        </br>substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good
        </br>cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the
        </br>agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered
        </br>as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some
        </br>credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat
        </br>sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.
        </br>
        </br>Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary
        </br>proportions.  A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep
        </br>affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair
        </br>or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will
        </br>patronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will
        </br>seize.
        </br>
        </br>The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room
        </br>with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now came
        </br>up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might
        </br>be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with--
        </br>
        </br>"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you
        </br>would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her
        </br>daughters."
        </br>
        </br>"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then."
        </br>
        </br>The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;
        </br>though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on
        </br>board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few
        </br>hours might comprehend.
        </br>
        </br>"But, if I know myself," said he, "this is from no want of gallantry
        </br>towards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all
        </br>one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations on
        </br>board such as women ought to have.  There can be no want of gallantry,
        </br>Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high,
        </br>and this is what I do.  I hate to hear of women on board, or to see
        </br>them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family
        </br>of ladies anywhere, if I can help it."
        </br>
        </br>This brought his sister upon him.
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you.--All idle
        </br>refinement!--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house
        </br>in England.  I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and
        </br>I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I
        </br>declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at
        </br>Kellynch Hall," (with a kind bow to Anne), "beyond what I always had in
        </br>most of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether."
        </br>
        </br>"Nothing to the purpose," replied her brother.  "You were living with
        </br>your husband, and were the only woman on board."
        </br>
        </br>"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin, and
        </br>three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this
        </br>superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?"
        </br>
        </br>"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any brother
        </br>officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville's
        </br>from the world's end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine that I did
        </br>not feel it an evil in itself."
        </br>
        </br>"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable."
        </br>
        </br>"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number of
        </br>women and children have no right to be comfortable on board."
        </br>
        </br>"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would
        </br>become of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to one
        </br>port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?"
        </br>
        </br>"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all
        </br>her family to Plymouth."
        </br>
        </br>"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if
        </br>women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.  We none of
        </br>us expect to be in smooth water all our days."
        </br>
        </br>"Ah! my dear," said the Admiral, "when he had got a wife, he will sing
        </br>a different tune.  When he is married, if we have the good luck to live
        </br>to another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many
        </br>others, have done.  We shall have him very thankful to anybody that
        </br>will bring him his wife."
        </br>
        </br>"Ay, that we shall."
        </br>
        </br>"Now I have done," cried Captain Wentworth.  "When once married people
        </br>begin to attack me with,--'Oh! you will think very differently, when
        </br>you are married.'  I can only say, 'No, I shall not;' and then they say
        </br>again, 'Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it."
        </br>
        </br>He got up and moved away.
        </br>
        </br>"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!" said Mrs Musgrove
        </br>to Mrs Croft.
        </br>
        </br>"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many
        </br>women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have
        </br>been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides
        </br>being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.
        </br>But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West
        </br>Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies."
        </br>
        </br>Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse
        </br>herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her
        </br>life.
        </br>
        </br>"And I do assure you, ma'am," pursued Mrs Croft, "that nothing can
        </br>exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the
        </br>higher rates.  When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more
        </br>confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of
        </br>them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been
        </br>spent on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was
        </br>nothing to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with
        </br>excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little
        </br>disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but
        </br>never knew what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really
        </br>suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself
        </br>unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by
        </br>myself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North
        </br>Seas.  I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of
        </br>imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I
        </br>should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing
        </br>ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience."
        </br>
        </br>"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,
        </br>Mrs Croft," was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.  "There is nothing so bad
        </br>as a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is, for
        </br>Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are
        </br>over, and he is safe back again."
        </br>
        </br>The evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed, Anne offered
        </br>her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with
        </br>tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be
        </br>employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.
        </br>
        </br>It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than
        </br>Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate him
        </br>which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of
        </br>all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females of the
        </br>family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the
        </br>honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they
        </br>both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued
        </br>appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have
        </br>made it credible that they were not decided rivals.  If he were a
        </br>little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could
        </br>wonder?
        </br>
        </br>These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers
        </br>were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,
        </br>equally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt that
        </br>he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features, perhaps,
        </br>trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed
        </br>him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly
        </br>aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his
        </br>having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?  The answer
        </br>was, "Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.  She had rather
        </br>play.  She is never tired of playing."  Once, too, he spoke to her.
        </br>She had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat
        </br>down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss
        </br>Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned to that part of the
        </br>room; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness--
        </br>
        </br>"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;" and though she
        </br>immediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced
        </br>to sit down again.
        </br>
        </br>Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.  His cold
        </br>politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.

        </br>Chapter 9
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as
        </br>he liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternal
        </br>kindness as of his wife's.  He had intended, on first arriving, to
        </br>proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in
        </br>that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this
        </br>off.  There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of
        </br>everything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so
        </br>hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to
        </br>remain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of
        </br>Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.
        </br>
        </br>It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves could
        </br>hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the
        </br>morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs
        </br>Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in
        </br>their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about
        </br>in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,
        </br>lately added to their establishment.
        </br>
        </br>Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the
        </br>Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying, warm admiration
        </br>everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established,
        </br>when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal
        </br>disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.
        </br>
        </br>Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,
        </br>pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a
        </br>considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's
        </br>introduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the
        </br>neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father's
        </br>house, only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home had
        </br>left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,
        </br>and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,
        </br>and of seeing Captain Wentworth.
        </br>
        </br>Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money, but
        </br>their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of
        </br>consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was
        </br>insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were
        </br>in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would,
        </br>from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living,
        </br>and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at
        </br>all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course
        </br>excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was
        </br>very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.
        </br>
        </br>The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no
        </br>pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a
        </br>consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them
        </br>pleased to improve their cousins.  Charles's attentions to Henrietta
        </br>had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.
        </br>"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,"--
        </br>and Henrietta did seem to like him.
        </br>
        </br>Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but
        </br>from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.
        </br>
        </br>Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet
        </br>quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.  Henrietta was
        </br>perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she knew not
        </br>now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most
        </br>likely to attract him.
        </br>
        </br>Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire
        </br>confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the
        </br>young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its
        </br>chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark
        </br>about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:
        </br>the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and
        </br>Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss
        </br>Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when
        </br>Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to
        </br>which was the one liked best.  Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for
        </br>Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be
        </br>extremely delightful.
        </br>
        </br>Charles "had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he
        </br>had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had
        </br>not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.  Here was a
        </br>fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might
        </br>be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as
        </br>likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.  Oh! it
        </br>would be a capital match for either of his sisters."
        </br>
        </br>"Upon my word it would," replied Mary.  "Dear me!  If he should rise to
        </br>any very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!  'Lady
        </br>Wentworth' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing, indeed, for
        </br>Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not
        </br>dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!  It would be but a new
        </br>creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations."
        </br>
        </br>It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very
        </br>account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put an
        </br>end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought
        </br>it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between
        </br>the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.
        </br>
        </br>"You know," said she, "I cannot think him at all a fit match for
        </br>Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,
        </br>she has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman
        </br>has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
        </br>to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to
        </br>those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles
        </br>Hayter?  Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss
        </br>Musgrove of Uppercross."
        </br>
        </br>Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having
        </br>a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw
        </br>things as an eldest son himself.
        </br>
        </br>"Now you are talking nonsense, Mary," was therefore his answer.  "It
        </br>would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair
        </br>chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in
        </br>the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he
        </br>is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty
        </br>property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and
        </br>fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best
        </br>land in the country.  I grant you, that any of them but Charles would
        </br>be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he
        </br>is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured,
        </br>good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he
        </br>will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different
        </br>sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible
        </br>man--good, freehold property.  No, no; Henrietta might do worse than
        </br>marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain
        </br>Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied."
        </br>
        </br>"Charles may say what he pleases," cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he
        </br>was out of the room, "but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry
        </br>Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and
        </br>therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon
        </br>put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he
        </br>has.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.  I wish
        </br>you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to Captain Wentworth's
        </br>liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he
        </br>certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.  But Charles is so
        </br>positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might
        </br>have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did,
        </br>unless you had been determined to give it against me."
        </br>
        </br>A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things
        </br>should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the
        </br>mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition
        </br>in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;
        </br>but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the
        </br>advantages of a quiet evening.
        </br>
        </br>As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence that
        </br>he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the
        </br>happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he
        </br>should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.  Either of
        </br>them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured
        </br>wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be
        </br>pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a
        </br>heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if
        </br>Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the
        </br>alternation could not be understood too soon.
        </br>
        </br>Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his
        </br>cousin's behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly
        </br>estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and
        </br>leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross:  but there
        </br>was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain
        </br>Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.  He had been absent
        </br>only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even
        </br>to the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his
        </br>present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then
        </br>seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who
        </br>for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties
        </br>of his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should
        </br>be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as
        </br>good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of
        </br>it.  The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of
        </br>going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better
        </br>curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr
        </br>Shirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get
        </br>through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to
        </br>Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came
        </br>back, alas!  the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not
        </br>listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held
        </br>with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain
        </br>Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to
        </br>give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude
        </br>of the negotiation.
        </br>
        </br>"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;
        </br>I always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short, you
        </br>know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.
        </br>Is he coming, Louisa?"
        </br>
        </br>One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne
        </br>had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at
        </br>the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles,
        </br>who was lying on the sofa.
        </br>
        </br>The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived
        </br>his manners of their usual composure:  he started, and could only say,
        </br>"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I
        </br>should find them here," before he walked to the window to recollect
        </br>himself, and feel how he ought to behave.
        </br>
        </br>"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few
        </br>moments, I dare say," had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that
        </br>was natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do
        </br>something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment,
        </br>and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.
        </br>
        </br>He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, "I
        </br>hope the little boy is better," was silent.
        </br>
        </br>She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy
        </br>her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very
        </br>great satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little
        </br>vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the
        </br>house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters
        </br>easy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight
        </br>of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of
        </br>Anne.
        </br>
        </br>She only attempted to say, "How do you do?  Will you not sit down?  The
        </br>others will be here presently."
        </br>
        </br>Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not
        </br>ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to
        </br>his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the
        </br>newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.
        </br>
        </br>Another minute brought another addition.  The younger boy, a remarkable
        </br>stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for
        </br>him by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and
        </br>went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his
        </br>claim to anything good that might be giving away.
        </br>
        </br>There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his
        </br>aunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten
        </br>himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was
        </br>about Charles, she could not shake him off.  She spoke to him, ordered,
        </br>entreated, and insisted in vain.  Once she did contrive to push him
        </br>away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back
        </br>again directly.
        </br>
        </br>"Walter," said she, "get down this moment.  You are extremely
        </br>troublesome.  I am very angry with you."
        </br>
        </br>"Walter," cried Charles Hayter, "why do you not do as you are bid?  Do
        </br>not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to cousin
        </br>Charles."
        </br>
        </br>But not a bit did Walter stir.
        </br>
        </br>In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of being
        </br>released from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bent
        </br>down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened
        </br>from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew
        </br>that Captain Wentworth had done it.
        </br>
        </br>Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.  She
        </br>could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,
        </br>with most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward to her
        </br>relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little
        </br>particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her
        </br>by the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant to
        </br>avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that her
        </br>conversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion of
        </br>varying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from,
        </br>till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make
        </br>over her little patient to their cares, and leave the room.  She could
        </br>not stay.  It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and
        </br>jealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but she could stay
        </br>for none of it.  It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well
        </br>inclined towards Captain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his
        </br>having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's
        </br>interference, "You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to
        </br>teaze your aunt;" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain
        </br>Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself.  But neither
        </br>Charles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her,
        </br>till she had a little better arranged her own.  She was ashamed of
        </br>herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a
        </br>trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude
        </br>and reflection to recover her.

        </br>Chapter 10
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.
        </br>Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
        </br>to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,
        </br>where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for
        </br>while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could not
        </br>but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory and
        </br>experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.  They
        </br>were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.  It was a little
        </br>fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with
        </br>some.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta
        </br>had sometimes the air of being divided between them.  Anne longed for
        </br>the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of
        </br>pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.  She
        </br>did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction to her
        </br>to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was
        </br>occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner.
        </br>He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of
        </br>Charles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for
        </br>accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.
        </br>
        </br>After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the
        </br>field.  Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross; a
        </br>most decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to
        </br>dinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some
        </br>large books before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be
        </br>right, and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.
        </br>It was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal
        </br>from Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence of
        </br>seeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was
        </br>wise.
        </br>
        </br>One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth
        </br>being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were
        </br>sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters
        </br>from the Mansion-house.
        </br>
        </br>It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through
        </br>the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that
        </br>they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could
        </br>not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some
        </br>jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, "Oh, yes, I should like
        </br>to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;" Anne felt
        </br>persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what
        </br>they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the
        </br>family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be
        </br>communicated, and everything being to be done together, however
        </br>undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but
        </br>in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss
        </br>Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as
        </br>she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the
        </br>interference in any plan of their own.
        </br>
        </br>"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long
        </br>walk," said Mary, as she went up stairs.  "Everybody is always
        </br>supposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been
        </br>pleased, if we had refused to join them.  When people come in this
        </br>manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?"
        </br>
        </br>Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken
        </br>out a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.
        </br>Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready
        </br>for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne have
        </br>foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some
        </br>feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was too
        </br>late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the
        </br>direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the
        </br>walk as under their guidance.
        </br>
        </br>Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the
        </br>narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep
        </br>with her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk must arise from
        </br>the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year
        </br>upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to
        </br>herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of
        </br>autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind
        </br>of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,
        </br>worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of
        </br>feeling.  She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like
        </br>musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach
        </br>of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,
        </br>she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.
        </br>It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate
        </br>footing, might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with
        </br>Henrietta.  Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her
        </br>sister.  This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one
        </br>speech of Louisa's which struck her.  After one of the many praises of
        </br>the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth
        </br>added:--
        </br>
        </br>"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to
        </br>take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of
        </br>these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.  I
        </br>wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen very
        </br>often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as
        </br>lieve be tossed out as not."
        </br>
        </br>"Ah! You make the most of it, I know," cried Louisa, "but if it were
        </br>really so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,
        </br>as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should
        </br>ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven
        </br>safely by anybody else."
        </br>
        </br>It was spoken with enthusiasm.
        </br>
        </br>"Had you?" cried he, catching the same tone; "I honour you!" And there
        </br>was silence between them for a little while.
        </br>
        </br>Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet
        </br>scenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,
        </br>fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining
        </br>happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone
        </br>together, blessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they
        </br>struck by order into another path, "Is not this one of the ways to
        </br>Winthrop?" But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.
        </br>
        </br>Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes to be
        </br>met with, strolling about near home--was their destination; and after
        </br>another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the
        </br>ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting
        </br>the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again,
        </br>they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted
        </br>Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter,
        </br>at the foot of the hill on the other side.
        </br>
        </br>Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them
        </br>an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and
        </br>buildings of a farm-yard.
        </br>
        </br>Mary exclaimed, "Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!
        </br>Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired."
        </br>
        </br>Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking
        </br>along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Mary
        </br>wished; but "No!" said Charles Musgrove, and "No, no!" cried Louisa
        </br>more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be arguing the
        </br>matter warmly.
        </br>
        </br>Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution
        </br>of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,
        </br>though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.  But this
        </br>was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and when
        </br>he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at
        </br>Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered, "Oh! no,
        </br>indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any
        </br>sitting down could do her good;" and, in short, her look and manner
        </br>declared, that go she would not.
        </br>
        </br>After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,
        </br>it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he and
        </br>Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and
        </br>cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the
        </br>hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she
        </br>went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta,
        </br>Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her, and saying
        </br>to Captain Wentworth--
        </br>
        </br>"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you, I
        </br>have never been in the house above twice in my life."
        </br>
        </br>She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,
        </br>followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne
        </br>perfectly knew the meaning of.
        </br>
        </br>The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisa
        </br>returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step
        </br>of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood
        </br>about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a
        </br>gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by
        </br>degrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she
        </br>quarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better
        </br>somewhere, and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a
        </br>better also.  She turned through the same gate, but could not see them.
        </br>Anne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the
        </br>hedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot
        </br>or other.  Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was
        </br>sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on
        </br>till she overtook her.
        </br>
        </br>Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon
        </br>heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if
        </br>making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the
        </br>centre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa's voice was the
        </br>first distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some eager
        </br>speech.  What Anne first heard was--
        </br>
        </br>"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened
        </br>from the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from
        </br>doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,
        </br>by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may
        </br>say?  No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have
        </br>made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have
        </br>made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near
        </br>giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!"
        </br>
        </br>"She would have turned back then, but for you?"
        </br>
        </br>"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it."
        </br>
        </br>"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints
        </br>you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last
        </br>time I was in company with him,  I need not affect to have no
        </br>comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than a mere dutiful
        </br>morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her
        </br>too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in
        </br>circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have not
        </br>resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.
        </br>Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of
        </br>decision and firmness, I see.  If you value her conduct or happiness,
        </br>infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no
        </br>doubt, you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too
        </br>yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be
        </br>depended on.  You are never sure of a good impression being durable;
        </br>everybody may sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is
        </br>a nut," said he, catching one down from an upper bough, "to exemplify:
        </br>a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has
        </br>outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not a weak spot
        </br>anywhere.  This nut," he continued, with playful solemnity, "while so
        </br>many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still
        </br>in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed
        </br>capable of."  Then returning to his former earnest tone--"My first
        </br>wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.  If
        </br>Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,
        </br>she will cherish all her present powers of mind."
        </br>
        </br>He had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if
        </br>Louisa could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such
        </br>interest, spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what
        </br>Louisa was feeling.  For herself, she feared to move, lest she should
        </br>be seen.  While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected
        </br>her, and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,
        </br>however, Louisa spoke again.
        </br>
        </br>"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects," said she; "but she does
        </br>sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot
        </br>pride.  She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.  We do so
        </br>wish that Charles had married Anne instead.  I suppose you know he
        </br>wanted to marry Anne?"
        </br>
        </br>After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--
        </br>
        </br>"Do you mean that she refused him?"
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! yes; certainly."
        </br>
        </br>"When did that happen?"
        </br>
        </br>"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;
        </br>but I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had
        </br>accepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better; and
        </br>papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell's
        </br>doing, that she did not.  They think Charles might not be learned and
        </br>bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she
        </br>persuaded Anne to refuse him."
        </br>
        </br>The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.  Her own
        </br>emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from, before
        </br>she could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely
        </br>hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great deal
        </br>of very painful import.  She saw how her own character was considered
        </br>by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling
        </br>and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme
        </br>agitation.
        </br>
        </br>As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walked
        </br>back with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort
        </br>in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once
        </br>more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence
        </br>which only numbers could give.
        </br>
        </br>Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,
        </br>Charles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne could not
        </br>attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to
        </br>perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the
        </br>gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they were now
        </br>very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.  Henrietta
        </br>looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles Hayter
        </br>exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other almost from the
        </br>first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.
        </br>
        </br>Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could
        </br>be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they
        </br>were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.  In
        </br>a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they
        </br>were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of
        </br>the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne
        </br>necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired
        </br>enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm; but Charles, though in
        </br>very good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife.  Mary had
        </br>shewn herself disobliging to him, and was now to reap the consequence,
        </br>which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut
        </br>off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when
        </br>Mary began to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according
        </br>to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded
        </br>on the other, he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which
        </br>he had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at
        </br>all.
        </br>
        </br>This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of
        </br>it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,
        </br>the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time
        </br>heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.  He
        </br>and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.
        </br>Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they
        </br>kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it
        </br>would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.
        </br>The invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves
        </br>were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked
        </br>before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could
        </br>not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.
        </br>
        </br>The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an
        </br>opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,
        </br>when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
        </br>to his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.
        </br>
        </br>"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired," cried Mrs Croft.  "Do let us
        </br>have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room for
        </br>three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might sit
        </br>four.  You must, indeed, you must."
        </br>
        </br>Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to
        </br>decline, she was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgency
        </br>came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused; they
        </br>compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a
        </br>corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her,
        </br>and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.
        </br>
        </br>Yes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had
        </br>placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that she
        </br>owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution to give
        </br>her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of his disposition
        </br>towards her, which all these things made apparent.  This little
        </br>circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.  She
        </br>understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not be
        </br>unfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with
        </br>high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and
        </br>though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,
        </br>without the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder of former
        </br>sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship;
        </br>it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not
        </br>contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that
        </br>she knew not which prevailed.
        </br>
        </br>Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at
        </br>first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way along the
        </br>rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.  She then
        </br>found them talking of "Frederick."
        </br>
        </br>"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,"
        </br>said the Admiral; "but there is no saying which.  He has been running
        </br>after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.
        </br>Ay, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have settled
        </br>it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long
        </br>courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear, between the
        </br>first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our
        </br>lodgings at North Yarmouth?"
        </br>
        </br>"We had better not talk about it, my dear," replied Mrs Croft,
        </br>pleasantly; "for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an
        </br>understanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy
        </br>together.  I had known you by character, however, long before."
        </br>
        </br>"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we
        </br>to wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.
        </br>I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home
        </br>one of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always be
        </br>company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly
        </br>know one from the other."
        </br>
        </br>"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed," said Mrs Croft, in a
        </br>tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers
        </br>might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; "and
        </br>a very respectable family.  One could not be connected with better
        </br>people.  My dear Admiral, that post!  we shall certainly take that
        </br>post."
        </br>
        </br>But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily
        </br>passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her
        </br>hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and
        </br>Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imagined
        </br>no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found
        </br>herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 11
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>The time now approached for Lady Russell's return:  the day was even
        </br>fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was
        </br>resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and
        </br>beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.
        </br>
        </br>It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within
        </br>half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and
        </br>there must be intercourse between the two families.  This was against
        </br>her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross,
        </br>that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him
        </br>behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed
        </br>she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as
        </br>certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary
        </br>for Lady Russell.
        </br>
        </br>She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain
        </br>Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed former meetings which
        </br>would be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious
        </br>for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting
        </br>anywhere.  They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance
        </br>now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she
        </br>might think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little.
        </br>
        </br>These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal
        </br>from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long
        </br>enough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some
        </br>sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there, but he was
        </br>gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.
        </br>
        </br>The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way which
        </br>she had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and
        </br>unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them
        </br>to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.
        </br>
        </br>A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at
        </br>last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled with
        </br>his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite
        </br>unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville had
        </br>never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two
        </br>years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him had determined
        </br>him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there for four-and-twenty
        </br>hours.  His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a
        </br>lively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine
        </br>country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an
        </br>earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither
        </br>was the consequence.
        </br>
        </br>The young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked
        </br>of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from
        </br>Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in
        </br>short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the
        </br>resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being
        </br>now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down
        </br>all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer;
        </br>and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa,
        </br>and Captain Wentworth.
        </br>
        </br>The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at
        </br>night; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not
        </br>consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the
        </br>middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,
        </br>after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for
        </br>going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,
        </br>and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.  This was felt
        </br>to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great
        </br>House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,
        </br>it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach
        </br>containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which he drove
        </br>Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and
        </br>entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was
        </br>very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them,
        </br>before the light and warmth of the day were gone.
        </br>
        </br>After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the
        </br>inns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly
        </br>down to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement
        </br>or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms were
        </br>shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the
        </br>residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings
        </br>themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street
        </br>almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round
        </br>the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing
        </br>machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new
        </br>improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to
        </br>the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very
        </br>strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate
        </br>environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in
        </br>its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive
        </br>sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by
        </br>dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the
        </br>happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in
        </br>unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of
        </br>Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic
        </br>rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant
        </br>growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the
        </br>first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a
        </br>state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may
        </br>more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of
        </br>Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the
        </br>worth of Lyme understood.
        </br>
        </br>The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and
        </br>melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves
        </br>on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a
        </br>first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,
        </br>proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on
        </br>Captain Wentworth's account:  for in a small house, near the foot of an
        </br>old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.  Captain
        </br>Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and he
        </br>was to join them on the Cobb.
        </br>
        </br>They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even
        </br>Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,
        </br>when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well
        </br>known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a
        </br>Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;
        </br>and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his return
        </br>from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and
        </br>an officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stamped
        </br>him well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little
        </br>history of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interesting
        </br>in the eyes of all the ladies.  He had been engaged to Captain
        </br>Harville's sister, and was now mourning her loss.  They had been a year
        </br>or two waiting for fortune and promotion.  Fortune came, his
        </br>prize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last;
        </br>but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.  She had died the preceding
        </br>summer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth believed it impossible
        </br>for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to
        </br>Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful
        </br>change.  He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer
        </br>heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring
        </br>manners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits.  To
        </br>finish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the
        </br>Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all
        </br>their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them
        </br>entirely.  Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a
        </br>year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to
        </br>a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the
        </br>country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly
        </br>adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will
        </br>excited towards Captain Benwick was very great.
        </br>
        </br>"And yet," said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the
        </br>party, "he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.  I
        </br>cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.  He is younger than
        </br>I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man.  He will
        </br>rally again, and be happy with another."
        </br>
        </br>They all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall, dark
        </br>man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from
        </br>strong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain
        </br>Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,
        </br>and, compared with either of them, a little man.  He had a pleasing
        </br>face and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from
        </br>conversation.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,
        </br>was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.  Mrs Harville,
        </br>a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the
        </br>same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their
        </br>desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because
        </br>the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their
        </br>entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.  The dinner,
        </br>already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted
        </br>as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should
        </br>have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing
        </br>of course that they should dine with them.
        </br>
        </br>There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such
        </br>a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike
        </br>the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality
        </br>and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by
        </br>an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.  "These would
        </br>have been all my friends," was her thought; and she had to struggle
        </br>against a great tendency to lowness.
        </br>
        </br>On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,
        </br>and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart
        </br>could think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had a moment's
        </br>astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in the
        </br>pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious
        </br>contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the
        </br>actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of
        </br>lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the
        </br>winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in the fitting-up of the
        </br>rooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the
        </br>common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a
        </br>rare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious
        </br>and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had
        </br>visited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with
        </br>his profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence
        </br>on his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it
        </br>presented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellent
        </br>accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable
        </br>collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.  His
        </br>lameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of
        </br>usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment
        </br>within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys
        </br>for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with
        </br>improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large
        </br>fishing-net at one corner of the room.
        </br>
        </br>Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the
        </br>house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into
        </br>raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their
        </br>friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness;
        </br>protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and
        </br>warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to
        </br>live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.
        </br>
        </br>They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered
        </br>already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being "so entirely
        </br>out of season," and the "no thoroughfare of Lyme," and the "no
        </br>expectation of company," had brought many apologies from the heads of
        </br>the inn.
        </br>
        </br>Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being
        </br>in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined could
        </br>ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and the
        </br>interchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got
        </br>beyond), was become a mere nothing.
        </br>
        </br>The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,
        </br>but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he
        </br>came, bringing his friend also, which was more than had been expected,
        </br>it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of
        </br>being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.  He ventured
        </br>among them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seem
        </br>fit for the mirth of the party in general.
        </br>
        </br>While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the
        </br>room, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance
        </br>to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed
        </br>rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her
        </br>nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.  He was shy, and
        </br>disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance,
        </br>and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well
        </br>repaid the first trouble of exertion.  He was evidently a young man of
        </br>considerable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and
        </br>besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's
        </br>indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companions
        </br>had probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to
        </br>him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling
        </br>against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their
        </br>conversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had rather
        </br>the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and
        </br>having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone
        </br>through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets,
        </br>trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be
        </br>preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and
        </br>moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed himself so
        </br>intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and
        </br>all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he
        </br>repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a
        </br>broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so
        </br>entirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he
        </br>did not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it was
        </br>the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who
        </br>enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could
        </br>estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but
        </br>sparingly.
        </br>
        </br>His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion to his
        </br>situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the
        </br>right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a larger
        </br>allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested to
        </br>particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such
        </br>collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth
        </br>and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse
        </br>and fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest
        </br>examples of moral and religious endurances.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the
        </br>interest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which
        </br>declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like
        </br>his, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised to
        </br>procure and read them.
        </br>
        </br>When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea of
        </br>her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
        </br>whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing, on more
        </br>serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and
        </br>preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct
        </br>would ill bear examination.
        </br>

        </br>
        </br>Chapter 12
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party the
        </br>next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.  They
        </br>went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine
        </br>south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so
        </br>flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning; gloried in the sea;
        </br>sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze--and were
        </br>silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the
        </br>sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been of
        </br>the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring
        </br>twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month,
        </br>did him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the
        </br>sea, always makes him feel young again.  Now, I cannot help thinking it
        </br>a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea.  I do think he had
        </br>better leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?
        </br>Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both
        </br>for himself and Mrs Shirley?  She has cousins here, you know, and many
        </br>acquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she
        </br>would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance
        </br>at hand, in case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it
        </br>quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley,
        </br>who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days
        </br>in a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut
        </br>out from all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.  I
        </br>really think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation, there
        </br>could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.  My
        </br>only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.
        </br>He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I
        </br>must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?  Do not
        </br>you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman
        </br>sacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well
        </br>performed by another person?  And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles
        </br>off, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was
        </br>anything to complain of."
        </br>
        </br>Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered
        </br>into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of
        </br>a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower
        </br>standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?  She said
        </br>all that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of
        </br>Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was that
        </br>he should have some active, respectable young man, as a resident
        </br>curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such
        </br>resident curate's being married.
        </br>
        </br>"I wish," said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, "I wish
        </br>Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley.  I
        </br>have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence
        </br>with everybody!  I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to
        </br>anything!  I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraid
        </br>of her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, and
        </br>wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross."
        </br>
        </br>Anne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful, and amused
        </br>also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta's
        </br>views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the
        </br>Musgrove family; she had only time, however, for a general answer, and
        </br>a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjects
        </br>suddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards
        </br>them.  They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be
        </br>ready; but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had
        </br>something to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her
        </br>into the town.  They were all at her disposal.
        </br>
        </br>When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a
        </br>gentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew
        </br>back, and stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him; and
        </br>as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a
        </br>degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.
        </br>She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty
        </br>features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine
        </br>wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of
        </br>eye which it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,
        </br>(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.  Captain
        </br>Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his
        </br>noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of
        </br>brightness, which seemed to say, "That man is struck with you, and even
        </br>I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again."
        </br>
        </br>After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about a
        </br>little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing
        </br>afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had
        </br>nearly run against the very same gentleman, as he came out of an
        </br>adjoining apartment.  She had before conjectured him to be a stranger
        </br>like themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was
        </br>strolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be his
        </br>servant.  Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.  It
        </br>was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this
        </br>second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman's
        </br>looks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and
        </br>propriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good
        </br>manners.  He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an
        </br>agreeable person.  Anne felt that she should like to know who he was.
        </br>
        </br>They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost
        </br>the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to
        </br>the window.  It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle, but only coming
        </br>round from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going
        </br>away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.
        </br>
        </br>The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare
        </br>it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity, and
        </br>the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the
        </br>curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and
        </br>civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.
        </br>
        </br>"Ah!" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at
        </br>Anne, "it is the very man we passed."
        </br>
        </br>The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him as
        </br>far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.
        </br>The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.
        </br>
        </br>"Pray," said Captain Wentworth, immediately, "can you tell us the name
        </br>of the gentleman who is just gone away?"
        </br>
        </br>"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last
        </br>night from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you
        </br>were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and
        </br>London."
        </br>
        </br>"Elliot!"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the
        </br>name, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity
        </br>of a waiter.
        </br>
        </br>"Bless me!" cried Mary; "it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr
        </br>Elliot, it must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you
        </br>see, just as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!  In the
        </br>very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?  my
        </br>father's next heir?  Pray sir," turning to the waiter, "did not you
        </br>hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch
        </br>family?"
        </br>
        </br>"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said his
        </br>master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day."
        </br>
        </br>"There! you see!" cried Mary in an ecstasy, "just as I said!  Heir to
        </br>Sir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out, if it was so.
        </br>Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care to
        </br>publish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary!
        </br>I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had been aware in time, who
        </br>it was, that he might have been introduced to us.  What a pity that we
        </br>should not have been introduced to each other!  Do you think he had the
        </br>Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him, I was looking at the
        </br>horses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, I
        </br>wonder the arms did not strike me!  Oh! the great-coat was hanging over
        </br>the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should
        </br>have observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in
        </br>mourning, one should have known him by the livery."
        </br>
        </br>"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together," said
        </br>Captain Wentworth, "we must consider it to be the arrangement of
        </br>Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin."
        </br>
        </br>When she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried to convince
        </br>her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years, been on
        </br>such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all
        </br>desirable.
        </br>
        </br>At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself to
        </br>have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was
        </br>undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.  She would not,
        </br>upon any account, mention her having met with him the second time;
        </br>luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in
        </br>their earlier walk, but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne's
        </br>having actually run against him in the passage, and received his very
        </br>polite excuses, while she had never been near him at all; no, that
        </br>cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret.
        </br>
        </br>"Of course," said Mary, "you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, the
        </br>next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly ought to hear
        </br>of it; do mention all about him."
        </br>
        </br>Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she
        </br>considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what
        </br>ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given her father,
        </br>many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it she
        </br>suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both
        </br>was beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil of
        </br>keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell
        </br>on Anne.
        </br>
        </br>Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and
        </br>Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take
        </br>their last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off for
        </br>Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together, and
        </br>out of doors as long as they could.
        </br>
        </br>Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all
        </br>fairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening did not
        </br>disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together some time,
        </br>talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable as
        </br>before, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike
        </br>of the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general
        </br>change amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had
        </br>Captain Harville by her side.
        </br>
        </br>"Miss Elliot," said he, speaking rather low, "you have done a good deed
        </br>in making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have such
        </br>company oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;
        </br>but what can we do?  We cannot part."
        </br>
        </br>"No," said Anne, "that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in
        </br>time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, and
        </br>you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called
        </br>a young mourner--only last summer, I understand."
        </br>
        </br>"Ay, true enough," (with a deep sigh) "only June."
        </br>
        </br>"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon."
        </br>
        </br>"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,
        </br>just made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of
        </br>him; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for
        </br>Portsmouth.  There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it?
        </br>not I.  I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could
        </br>do it, but that good fellow" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  "The
        </br>Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her being
        </br>sent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up for
        </br>leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and
        </br>day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant,
        </br>and never left the poor fellow for a week.  That's what he did, and
        </br>nobody else could have saved poor James.  You may think, Miss Elliot,
        </br>whether he is dear to us!"
        </br>
        </br>Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much
        </br>in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to
        </br>bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he
        </br>spoke again, it was of something totally different.
        </br>
        </br>Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have
        </br>quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the
        </br>direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they
        </br>would accompany them to their door, and then return and set off
        </br>themselves.  By all their calculations there was just time for this;
        </br>but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk
        </br>along it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so
        </br>determined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,
        </br>would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and
        </br>all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be
        </br>imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door,
        </br>and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them
        </br>to the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb.
        </br>
        </br>Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron's "dark
        </br>blue seas" could not fail of being brought forward by their present
        </br>view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention
        </br>was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.
        </br>
        </br>There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant
        </br>for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and
        </br>all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,
        </br>excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.
        </br>In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; the
        </br>sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement for her
        </br>feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it,
        </br>however.  She was safely down, and instantly, to show her enjoyment,
        </br>ran up the steps to be jumped down again.  He advised her against it,
        </br>thought the jar too great; but no, he reasoned and talked in vain, she
        </br>smiled and said, "I am determined I will:" he put out his hands; she
        </br>was too precipitate by half a second, she fell on the pavement on the
        </br>Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!  There was no wound, no blood,
        </br>no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her face
        </br>was like death.  The horror of the moment to all who stood around!
        </br>
        </br>Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,
        </br>looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of
        </br>silence.  "She is dead! she is dead!" screamed Mary, catching hold of
        </br>her husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him
        </br>immoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the
        </br>conviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps,
        </br>but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between
        </br>them.
        </br>
        </br>"Is there no one to help me?" were the first words which burst from
        </br>Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all his own strength
        </br>were gone.
        </br>
        </br>"Go to him, go to him," cried Anne, "for heaven's sake go to him.  I
        </br>can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands, rub
        </br>her temples; here are salts; take them, take them."
        </br>
        </br>Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaging
        </br>himself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raised
        </br>up and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that
        </br>Anne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering
        </br>against the wall for his support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony--
        </br>
        </br>"Oh God! her father and mother!"
        </br>
        </br>"A surgeon!" said Anne.
        </br>
        </br>He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--
        </br>"True, true, a surgeon this instant," was darting away, when Anne
        </br>eagerly suggested--
        </br>
        </br>"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?  He knows
        </br>where a surgeon is to be found."
        </br>
        </br>Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a
        </br>moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resigned
        </br>the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's care, and was
        </br>off for the town with the utmost rapidity.
        </br>
        </br>As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which
        </br>of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain
        </br>Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother,
        </br>hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes from
        </br>one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness
        </br>the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which he
        </br>could not give.
        </br>
        </br>Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which
        </br>instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggest
        </br>comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, to
        </br>assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her
        </br>for directions.
        </br>
        </br>"Anne, Anne," cried Charles, "What is to be done next?  What, in
        </br>heaven's name, is to be done next?"
        </br>
        </br>Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.
        </br>
        </br>"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure: carry her
        </br>gently to the inn."
        </br>
        </br>"Yes, yes, to the inn," repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively
        </br>collected, and eager to be doing something.  "I will carry her myself.
        </br>Musgrove, take care of the others."
        </br>
        </br>By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen
        </br>and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be
        </br>useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady,
        </br>nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first
        </br>report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was
        </br>consigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and
        </br>in this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his
        </br>wife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the
        </br>ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they
        </br>had passed along.
        </br>
        </br>They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.  Captain
        </br>Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which
        </br>showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,
        </br>informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.  Shocked as
        </br>Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be
        </br>instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was
        </br>to be done.  She must be taken to their house; all must go to their
        </br>house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.  They would not listen to
        </br>scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and while
        </br>Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction, was conveyed up stairs, and
        </br>given possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives
        </br>were supplied by her husband to all who needed them.
        </br>
        </br>Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, without
        </br>apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life, however, of
        </br>service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable of
        </br>being in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hope
        </br>and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.  Mary, too, was
        </br>growing calmer.
        </br>
        </br>The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.  They
        </br>were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.  The
        </br>head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries
        </br>recovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.
        </br>
        </br>That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a
        </br>few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and
        </br>the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a
        </br>few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may
        </br>be conceived.
        </br>
        </br>The tone, the look, with which "Thank God!" was uttered by Captain
        </br>Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight
        </br>of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded
        </br>arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of
        </br>his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.
        </br>
        </br>Louisa's limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.
        </br>
        </br>It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be
        </br>done, as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to
        </br>each other and consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however
        </br>distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such
        </br>trouble, did not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The
        </br>Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all
        </br>gratitude.  They had looked forward and arranged everything before the
        </br>others began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to
        </br>them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.  They
        </br>were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet
        </br>perhaps, by "putting the children away in the maid's room, or swinging
        </br>a cot somewhere," they could hardly bear to think of not finding room
        </br>for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though,
        </br>with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the
        </br>least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.  Mrs
        </br>Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had
        </br>lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such
        </br>another.  Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by
        </br>day or night.  And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of
        </br>feeling irresistible.
        </br>
        </br>Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in
        </br>consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of
        </br>perplexity and terror.  "Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going
        </br>to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr
        </br>and Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone
        </br>since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in
        </br>tolerable time." At first, they were capable of nothing more to the
        </br>purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,
        </br>exerting himself, said--
        </br>
        </br>"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.  Every
        </br>minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross
        </br>instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go."
        </br>
        </br>Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.  He
        </br>would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;
        </br>but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor
        </br>would.  So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the
        </br>same.  She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The
        </br>usefulness of her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in
        </br>Louisa's room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her
        </br>worse than helpless!  She was forced to acknowledge that she could do
        </br>no good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the
        </br>thought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented, she
        </br>was anxious to be at home.
        </br>
        </br>The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from
        </br>Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door
        </br>was open.
        </br>
        </br>"Then it is settled, Musgrove," cried Captain Wentworth, "that you
        </br>stay, and that I take care of your sister home.  But as to the rest, as
        </br>to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be
        </br>only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to
        </br>her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as
        </br>Anne."
        </br>
        </br>She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so
        </br>spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then
        </br>appeared.
        </br>
        </br>"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;" cried he,
        </br>turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which
        </br>seemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply, and he
        </br>recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself most
        </br>willing, ready, happy to remain.  "It was what she had been thinking
        </br>of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor in Louisa's
        </br>room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so."
        </br>
        </br>One thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather
        </br>desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some
        </br>share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take
        </br>them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain
        </br>Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much
        </br>better for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove's
        </br>carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there
        </br>would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa's night.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,
        </br>and to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was made
        </br>known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.  She was
        </br>so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being
        </br>expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa,
        </br>while she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta's
        </br>stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?  And to go home
        </br>without Charles, too, without her husband!  No, it was too unkind.  And
        </br>in short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as
        </br>none of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for
        </br>it; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable.
        </br>
        </br>Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and
        </br>ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the
        </br>town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending
        </br>to her.  She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along, to
        </br>the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in
        </br>the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes for Dr
        </br>Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot;
        </br>a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or
        </br>those who were wrapt up in her welfare.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united as
        </br>they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing
        </br>degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that
        </br>it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in
        </br>waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the
        </br>street; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of
        </br>one sister for the other, the change in his countenance, the
        </br>astonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles
        </br>was listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at
        </br>least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to
        </br>Louisa.
        </br>
        </br>She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating the
        </br>feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on
        </br>Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and
        </br>she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink
        </br>unnecessarily from the office of a friend.
        </br>
        </br>In the mean while she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,
        </br>and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these
        </br>circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted
        </br>Lyme.  How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their
        </br>manners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not
        </br>foresee.  It was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to
        </br>Henrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always
        </br>with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In
        </br>general, his voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta
        </br>from agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only, when she had
        </br>been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb,
        </br>bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, as
        </br>if wholly overcome--
        </br>
        </br>"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it," he cried.  "Oh God! that I had
        </br>not given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!  But
        </br>so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!"
        </br>
        </br>Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the
        </br>justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and
        </br>advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him
        </br>that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its
        </br>proportions and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to
        </br>feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of
        </br>happiness as a very resolute character.
        </br>
        </br>They got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and
        </br>the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by some dread
        </br>of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day
        </br>before.  It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the
        </br>neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among
        </br>them for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl
        </br>over her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep;
        </br>when, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at
        </br>once addressed by Captain Wentworth.  In a low, cautious voice, he
        </br>said:--
        </br>
        </br>"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not appear at
        </br>first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether you had
        </br>not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it
        </br>to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?"
        </br>
        </br>She did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance of
        </br>the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship, and of
        </br>deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a
        </br>sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.
        </br>
        </br>When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had
        </br>seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the
        </br>daughter all the better for being with them, he announced his intention
        </br>of returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were
        </br>baited, he was off.
        </br>
        </br>(End of volume one.)

        </br>
        </br>Chapter 13
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two
        </br>days, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the
        </br>satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an
        </br>immediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the
        </br>future, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits,
        </br>would have been difficulties.
        </br>
        </br>They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was much
        </br>the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.  Charles came a
        </br>few hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account.  He
        </br>was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure must not be hoped, but
        </br>everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.  In
        </br>speaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of
        </br>their kindness, especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.
        </br>"She really left nothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been
        </br>persuaded to go early to their inn last night.  Mary had been
        </br>hysterical again this morning.  When he came away, she was going to
        </br>walk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good.  He
        </br>almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before;
        </br>but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do."
        </br>
        </br>Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had at
        </br>first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.  It
        </br>would be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his
        </br>own distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon.  A
        </br>chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far
        </br>more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who
        </br>having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the
        </br>lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his
        </br>brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and
        </br>dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her, and who,
        </br>consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse
        </br>dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurred
        </br>before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly
        </br>have been resolved on, and found practicable so soon.
        </br>
        </br>They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minute
        </br>knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain every
        </br>twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his
        </br>account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense and
        </br>consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed in
        </br>Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.
        </br>
        </br>Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.
        </br>"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters for
        </br>one another."  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought she
        </br>could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to
        </br>which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.  She
        </br>had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go
        </br>to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it
        </br>suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.  They must be
        </br>taking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they might
        </br>at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children; and in
        </br>short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with
        </br>what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morning
        </br>at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending
        </br>them off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary range
        </br>of the house was the consequence.
        </br>
        </br>She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was the
        </br>very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated
        </br>both houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.
        </br>A few days had made a change indeed!
        </br>
        </br>If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than former
        </br>happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt, to her mind
        </br>there was none, of what would follow her recovery.  A few months hence,
        </br>and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self,
        </br>might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was
        </br>glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne
        </br>Elliot!
        </br>
        </br>An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark
        </br>November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few
        </br>objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the
        </br>sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though
        </br>desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an
        </br>adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda,
        </br>or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of
        </br>the village, without a saddened heart.  Scenes had passed in Uppercross
        </br>which made it precious.  It stood the record of many sensations of
        </br>pain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting
        </br>feeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could
        </br>never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.  She
        </br>left it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things had
        </br>been.
        </br>
        </br>Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell's house
        </br>in September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its
        </br>being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and
        </br>escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern
        </br>and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of its
        </br>mistress.
        </br>
        </br>There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.
        </br>She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily, either Anne
        </br>was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so;
        </br>and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the
        </br>amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin,
        </br>and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth
        </br>and beauty.
        </br>
        </br>When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental
        </br>change.  The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving
        </br>Kellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to
        </br>smother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.
        </br>She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.
        </br>Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Lady
        </br>Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke her
        </br>satisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, and
        </br>her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them, Anne would have
        </br>been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme
        </br>and Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there; how much more
        </br>interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and
        </br>Captain Benwick, than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her
        </br>own sister's intimacy with Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert
        </br>herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal
        </br>solicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.
        </br>
        </br>There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another
        </br>subject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.  Lady Russell had
        </br>not been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of
        </br>the whole had burst on her; but still it must be talked of, she must
        </br>make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and
        </br>Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.  Anne was conscious
        </br>of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.  She could not speak the name,
        </br>and look straight forward to Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted
        </br>the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment
        </br>between him and Louisa.  When this was told, his name distressed her no
        </br>longer.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but
        </br>internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,
        </br>that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of
        </br>the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed
        </br>by a Louisa Musgrove.
        </br>
        </br>The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance
        </br>to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which
        </br>found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a rather
        </br>improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period, Lady Russell's
        </br>politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of
        </br>the past became in a decided tone, "I must call on Mrs Croft; I really
        </br>must call upon her soon.  Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay
        </br>a visit in that house?  It will be some trial to us both."
        </br>
        </br>Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she
        </br>said, in observing--
        </br>
        </br>"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your
        </br>feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.  By remaining in
        </br>the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it."
        </br>
        </br>She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an
        </br>opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate in
        </br>his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the
        </br>poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed
        </br>for the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel
        </br>that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall
        </br>had passed into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions must
        </br>unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they
        </br>precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the
        </br>house again, and returning through the well-known apartments.
        </br>
        </br>In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, "These rooms
        </br>ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen in their destination!  How
        </br>unworthily occupied!  An ancient family to be so driven away!
        </br>Strangers filling their place!" No, except when she thought of her
        </br>mother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside, she
        </br>had no sigh of that description to heave.
        </br>
        </br>Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of
        </br>fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving
        </br>her in that house, there was particular attention.
        </br>
        </br>The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on
        </br>comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each
        </br>lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that
        </br>Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since
        </br>the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not been
        </br>able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then
        </br>returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting
        </br>it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; had
        </br>expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being the worse for her
        </br>exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.  This was
        </br>handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could
        </br>have done.
        </br>
        </br>As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one
        </br>style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to
        </br>work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had
        </br>been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that
        </br>its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how
        </br>long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she
        </br>would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!  The
        </br>Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--
        </br>
        </br>"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this, for a young
        </br>fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head, is not it,
        </br>Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!"
        </br>
        </br>Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady
        </br>Russell, but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity
        </br>of character were irresistible.
        </br>
        </br>"Now, this must be very bad for you," said he, suddenly rousing from a
        </br>little reverie, "to be coming and finding us here.  I had not
        </br>recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.  But now, do
        </br>not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms in the house
        </br>if you like it."
        </br>
        </br>"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now."
        </br>
        </br>"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery at
        </br>any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by
        </br>that door.  A good place is not it?  But," (checking himself), "you
        </br>will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the
        </br>butler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.  One man's ways may be
        </br>as good as another's, but we all like our own best.  And so you must
        </br>judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the
        </br>house or not."
        </br>
        </br>Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.
        </br>
        </br>"We have made very few changes either," continued the Admiral, after
        </br>thinking a moment.  "Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door, at
        </br>Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.  The wonder was,
        </br>how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its
        </br>opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter what we have
        </br>done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house
        </br>ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few
        </br>alterations we have made have been all very much for the better.  My
        </br>wife should have the credit of them, however.  I have done very little
        </br>besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my
        </br>dressing-room, which was your father's.  A very good man, and very much
        </br>the gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot," (looking
        </br>with serious reflection), "I should think he must be rather a dressy
        </br>man for his time of life.  Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord!
        </br>there was no getting away from one's self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a
        </br>hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with
        </br>my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I
        </br>never go near."
        </br>
        </br>Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,
        </br>and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up
        </br>the subject again, to say--
        </br>
        </br>"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give
        </br>him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here
        </br>quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.
        </br>The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only
        </br>when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three
        </br>times a winter.  And take it altogether, now that we have been into
        </br>most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we
        </br>like better than this.  Pray say so, with my compliments.  He will be
        </br>glad to hear it."
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but
        </br>the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at
        </br>present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to
        </br>be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north
        </br>of the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady
        </br>Russell would be removing to Bath.
        </br>
        </br>So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch
        </br>Hall, or of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe
        </br>enough, and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on
        </br>the subject.

        </br>
        </br>Chapter 14
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and
        </br>Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all
        </br>wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and
        </br>as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to
        </br>the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head,
        </br>though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the
        </br>highest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be
        </br>altogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she
        </br>might be able to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, who
        </br>must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas
        </br>holidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.
        </br>
        </br>They had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs
        </br>Harville's children away as much as she could, every possible supply
        </br>from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the
        </br>Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner
        </br>every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each
        </br>side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable.
        </br>
        </br>Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her
        </br>staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.  Charles
        </br>Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when they dined
        </br>with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at
        </br>first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then,
        </br>she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out
        </br>whose daughter she was, and there had been so much going on every day,
        </br>there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,
        </br>and she had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that
        </br>the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme.  She had been
        </br>taken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had gone to church,
        </br>and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at
        </br>Lyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so
        </br>very useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight.
        </br>
        </br>Anne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary's face was clouded directly.
        </br>Charles laughed.
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very odd
        </br>young man.  I do not know what he would be at.  We asked him to come
        </br>home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook to give him some
        </br>shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it
        </br>was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward
        </br>sort of excuse; 'he never shot' and he had 'been quite misunderstood,'
        </br>and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it
        </br>was, I found, that he did not mean to come.  I suppose he was afraid of
        </br>finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively
        </br>enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick."
        </br>
        </br>Charles laughed again and said, "Now Mary, you know very well how it
        </br>really was.  It was all your doing," (turning to Anne.) "He fancied
        </br>that if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied
        </br>everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady
        </br>Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not
        </br>courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour, Mary knows it is."
        </br>
        </br>But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not
        </br>considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in
        </br>love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater
        </br>attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.
        </br>Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard.
        </br>She boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries.
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! he talks of you," cried Charles, "in such terms--" Mary
        </br>interrupted him. "I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne
        </br>twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne, he never talks of you
        </br>at all."
        </br>
        </br>"No," admitted Charles, "I do not know that he ever does, in a general
        </br>way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you
        </br>exceedingly.  His head is full of some books that he is reading upon
        </br>your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has
        </br>found out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh! I
        </br>cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I
        </br>overheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot'
        </br>was spoken of in the highest terms!  Now Mary, I declare it was so, I
        </br>heard it myself, and you were in the other room.  'Elegance, sweetness,
        </br>beauty.' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms."
        </br>
        </br>"And I am sure," cried Mary, warmly, "it was a very little to his
        </br>credit, if he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart is
        </br>very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure you will
        </br>agree with me."
        </br>
        </br>"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide," said Lady Russell,
        </br>smiling.
        </br>
        </br>"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,"
        </br>said Charles.  "Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, and
        </br>setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will make
        </br>his way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it.  I
        </br>told him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church's
        </br>being so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sort
        </br>of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with
        </br>all his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that you
        </br>will have him calling here soon.  So, I give you notice, Lady Russell."
        </br>
        </br>"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me," was Lady
        </br>Russell's kind answer.
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance," said Mary, "I think he is rather
        </br>my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last
        </br>fortnight."
        </br>
        </br>"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see
        </br>Captain Benwick."
        </br>
        </br>"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.
        </br>He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with
        </br>me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a
        </br>word.  He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not
        </br>like him."
        </br>
        </br>"There we differ, Mary," said Anne.  "I think Lady Russell would like
        </br>him.  I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she
        </br>would very soon see no deficiency in his manner."
        </br>
        </br>"So do I, Anne," said Charles.  "I am sure Lady Russell would like him.
        </br>He is just Lady Russell's sort.  Give him a book, and he will read all
        </br>day long."
        </br>
        </br>"Yes, that he will!" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  "He will sit poring
        </br>over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one
        </br>drop's one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think Lady
        </br>Russell would like that?"
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell could not help laughing.  "Upon my word," said she, "I
        </br>should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted
        </br>of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may
        </br>call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give
        </br>occasion to such directly opposite notions.  I wish he may be induced
        </br>to call here.  And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my
        </br>opinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand."
        </br>
        </br>"You will not like him, I will answer for it."
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with
        </br>animation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so
        </br>extraordinarily.
        </br>
        </br>"He is a man," said Lady Russell, "whom I have no wish to see.  His
        </br>declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left
        </br>a very strong impression in his disfavour with me."
        </br>
        </br>This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short in the
        </br>midst of the Elliot countenance.
        </br>
        </br>With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,
        </br>there was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been
        </br>greatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved, he
        </br>had improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he
        </br>had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely
        </br>fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did
        </br>not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of
        </br>going away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had
        </br>talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade
        </br>Captain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last,
        </br>Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.
        </br>
        </br>There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally
        </br>thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.  Lady Russell could not
        </br>hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor
        </br>could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her
        </br>father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without
        </br>wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.  Captain Benwick
        </br>came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it than Charles had
        </br>imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week's indulgence,
        </br>Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had
        </br>been beginning to excite.
        </br>
        </br>The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from
        </br>school, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve
        </br>the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained
        </br>with Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual
        </br>quarters.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne
        </br>could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.
        </br>Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain
        </br>Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could
        </br>be wished to the last state she had seen it in.
        </br>
        </br>Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom
        </br>she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from
        </br>the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side was a table
        </br>occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and
        </br>on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn
        </br>and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole
        </br>completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be
        </br>heard, in spite of all the noise of the others.  Charles and Mary also
        </br>came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of
        </br>paying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten
        </br>minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the
        </br>children on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.
        </br>
        </br>Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such a
        </br>domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa's
        </br>illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anne
        </br>near her on purpose to thank her most cordially, again and again, for
        </br>all her attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what
        </br>she had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the
        </br>room, that after all she had gone through, nothing was so likely to do
        </br>her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.
        </br>
        </br>Louisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her
        </br>being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters
        </br>went to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her and
        </br>stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,
        </br>for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.
        </br>
        </br>"I hope I shall remember, in future," said Lady Russell, as soon as
        </br>they were reseated in the carriage, "not to call at Uppercross in the
        </br>Christmas holidays."
        </br>
        </br>Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and
        </br>sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather
        </br>than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was
        </br>entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course
        </br>of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of
        </br>other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of
        </br>newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of
        </br>pattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises which belonged
        </br>to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; and
        </br>like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after being
        </br>long in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet
        </br>cheerfulness.
        </br>
        </br>Anne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,
        </br>though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view
        </br>of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing
        </br>them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however
        </br>disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when she
        </br>arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of
        </br>Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.
        </br>
        </br>Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some
        </br>interest.  Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had
        </br>called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If
        </br>Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking
        </br>much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the
        </br>connection, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was
        </br>very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very
        </br>agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting
        </br>the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being "a man
        </br>whom she had no wish to see."  She had a great wish to see him.  If he
        </br>really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be
        </br>forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.
        </br>
        </br>Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she
        </br>felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was more
        </br>than she could say for many other persons in Bath.
        </br>
        </br>She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her
        </br>own lodgings, in Rivers Street.
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 15
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty
        </br>dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he
        </br>and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.
        </br>
        </br>Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of
        </br>many months, and anxiously saying to herself, "Oh! when shall I leave
        </br>you again?"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome
        </br>she received, did her good.  Her father and sister were glad to see
        </br>her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture, and met her
        </br>with kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was
        </br>noticed as an advantage.
        </br>
        </br>Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and
        </br>smiles were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she
        </br>would pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of
        </br>the others was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,
        </br>and she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination to
        </br>listen to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being deeply
        </br>regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they
        </br>had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all
        </br>their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it
        </br>was all Bath.
        </br>
        </br>They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered
        </br>their expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly the
        </br>best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages
        </br>over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the
        </br>superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste
        </br>of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.
        </br>Everybody was wanting to visit them.  They had drawn back from many
        </br>introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people
        </br>of whom they knew nothing.
        </br>
        </br>Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father and
        </br>sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh that her
        </br>father should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing to
        </br>regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should
        </br>find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she must
        </br>sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the
        </br>folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the
        </br>other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who
        </br>had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of
        </br>between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.
        </br>
        </br>But this was not all which they had to make them happy.  They had Mr
        </br>Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.  He was not
        </br>only pardoned, they were delighted with him.  He had been in Bath about
        </br>a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his way to
        </br>London, when the intelligence of Sir Walter's being settled there had
        </br>of course reached him, though only twenty-four hours in the place, but
        </br>he had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a
        </br>fortnight in Bath, and his first object on arriving, had been to leave
        </br>his card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours
        </br>to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,
        </br>such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be
        </br>received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was
        </br>completely re-established.
        </br>
        </br>They had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away all the
        </br>appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated in
        </br>misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of throwing himself
        </br>off; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and
        </br>delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint of having spoken
        </br>disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he
        </br>was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and
        </br>whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the
        </br>unfeudal tone of the present day.  He was astonished, indeed, but his
        </br>character and general conduct must refute it.  He could refer Sir
        </br>Walter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking
        </br>on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the
        </br>footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his
        </br>opinions on the subject.
        </br>
        </br>The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much
        </br>extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but
        </br>a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable
        </br>man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter
        </br>added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and
        </br>had, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance
        </br>through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the
        </br>marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.
        </br>
        </br>Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also
        </br>with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.  She was
        </br>certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich,
        </br>and excessively in love with his friend.  There had been the charm.
        </br>She had sought him.  Without that attraction, not all her money would
        </br>have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her
        </br>having been a very fine woman.  Here was a great deal to soften the
        </br>business.  A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!
        </br>Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth
        </br>could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she
        </br>allowed it be a great extenuation.
        </br>
        </br>Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently
        </br>delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners
        </br>in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and
        </br>placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.
        </br>
        </br>Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances, large
        </br>allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.
        </br>She heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant or
        </br>irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
        </br>but in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had the
        </br>sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in
        </br>Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well
        </br>received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by being
        </br>on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.  In
        </br>all probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch
        </br>estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.  A sensible man,
        </br>and he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object
        </br>to him?  She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for
        </br>Elizabeth's sake.  There might really have been a liking formerly,
        </br>though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and now
        </br>that he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay his
        </br>addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with
        </br>well-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have been
        </br>penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very young
        </br>himself.  How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation
        </br>of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a
        </br>fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too
        </br>nice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth
        </br>was disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was
        </br>encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,
        </br>while Mr Elliot's frequent visits were talked of.
        </br>
        </br>Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without
        </br>being much attended to.  "Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.
        </br>They did not know.  It might be him, perhaps."  They could not listen
        </br>to her description of him.  They were describing him themselves; Sir
        </br>Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike
        </br>appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, his
        </br>sensible eye; but, at the same time, "must lament his being very much
        </br>under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he
        </br>pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for
        </br>the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) was
        </br>looking exactly as he had done when they last parted;" but Sir Walter
        </br>had "not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had
        </br>embarrassed him.  He did not mean to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was
        </br>better to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seen
        </br>with him anywhere."
        </br>
        </br>Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the
        </br>whole evening.  "Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced
        </br>to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!" and there was a Mrs
        </br>Wallis, at present known only to them by description, as she was in
        </br>daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as "a
        </br>most charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place," and
        </br>as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.  Sir Walter
        </br>thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty
        </br>woman, beautiful.  "He longed to see her.  He hoped she might make some
        </br>amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the
        </br>streets.  The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.  He did
        </br>not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the
        </br>plain was out of all proportion.  He had frequently observed, as he
        </br>walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or
        </br>five-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond
        </br>Street, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,
        </br>without there being a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty
        </br>morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a
        </br>thousand could stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were a
        </br>dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!  they
        </br>were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!
        </br>It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
        </br>tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.  He
        </br>had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a
        </br>fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every
        </br>woman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was sure to be upon Colonel
        </br>Wallis."  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed to escape, however.
        </br>His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis's
        </br>companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly
        </br>was not sandy-haired.
        </br>
        </br>"How is Mary looking?" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good
        </br>humour.  "The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that
        </br>may not happen every day."
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been
        </br>in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas."
        </br>
        </br>"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and grow
        </br>coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse."
        </br>
        </br>Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,
        </br>or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the
        </br>door suspended everything.  "A knock at the door! and so late!  It was
        </br>ten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine in
        </br>Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home
        </br>to ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.  Mrs Clay
        </br>decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock."  Mrs Clay was right.  With all
        </br>the state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliot was ushered
        </br>into the room.
        </br>
        </br>It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.
        </br>Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments, and
        </br>her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but "he
        </br>could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her
        </br>friend had taken cold the day before," &c. &c; which was all as
        </br>politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part must
        </br>follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter; "Mr Elliot
        </br>must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter" (there was
        </br>no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very
        </br>becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no
        </br>means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his little start
        </br>of surprise, that he had not been at all aware of who she was.  He
        </br>looked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his
        </br>eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the
        </br>relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an
        </br>acquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking as he had appeared
        </br>at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking, and his manners were so
        </br>exactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly
        </br>agreeable, that she could compare them in excellence to only one
        </br>person's manners.  They were not the same, but they were, perhaps,
        </br>equally good.
        </br>
        </br>He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.
        </br>There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes were
        </br>enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions, his choice of
        </br>subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a
        </br>sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could, he began to talk to
        </br>her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but
        </br>especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to
        </br>be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route,
        </br>understand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost such
        </br>an opportunity of paying his respects to her.  She gave him a short
        </br>account of her party and business at Lyme.  His regret increased as he
        </br>listened.  He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room
        </br>adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they
        </br>must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but
        </br>certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow
        </br>of a right to introduce himself.  If he had but asked who the party
        </br>were!  The name of Musgrove would have told him enough.  "Well, it
        </br>would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a
        </br>question at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on
        </br>the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.
        </br>
        </br>"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty," said he, "as to
        </br>what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing, are more
        </br>absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.
        </br>The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the
        </br>folly of what they have in view."
        </br>
        </br>But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone: he knew
        </br>it; he was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at
        </br>intervals that he could return to Lyme.
        </br>
        </br>His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene she
        </br>had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.  Having
        </br>alluded to "an accident,"  he must hear the whole.  When he questioned,
        </br>Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in
        </br>their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.  She could only compare
        </br>Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had
        </br>passed, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in
        </br>witnessing it.
        </br>
        </br>He staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece
        </br>had struck "eleven with its silver sounds," and the watchman was
        </br>beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr
        </br>Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.
        </br>
        </br>Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in
        </br>Camden Place could have passed so well!
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 16
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would have
        </br>been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's being in love
        </br>with Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being in love with Mrs
        </br>Clay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at
        </br>home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast the next morning, she
        </br>found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of
        </br>meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that
        </br>"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself at all wanted;"
        </br>for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, "That must not be any
        </br>reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.  She is nothing to me,
        </br>compared with you;"  and she was in full time to hear her father say,
        </br>"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet, you have seen nothing of
        </br>Bath.  You have been here only to be useful.  You must not run away
        </br>from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, the
        </br>beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind, I well know the sight of
        </br>beauty is a real gratification."
        </br>
        </br>He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised to
        </br>see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.  Her
        </br>countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise
        </br>of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister.  The
        </br>lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.
        </br>
        </br>In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be
        </br>alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he
        </br>thought her "less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her
        </br>complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been using any
        </br>thing in particular?"  "No, nothing."  "Merely Gowland," he supposed.
        </br>"No, nothing at all."  "Ha! he was surprised at that;" and added,
        </br>"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot
        </br>be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of
        </br>Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been using it at my
        </br>recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.  You see how it
        </br>has carried away her freckles."
        </br>
        </br>If Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise might
        </br>have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne that the
        </br>freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must take its chance.
        </br>The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also
        </br>to marry.  As for herself, she might always command a home with Lady
        </br>Russell.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
        </br>on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs
        </br>Clay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual
        </br>provocation to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a
        </br>person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and
        </br>has a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.
        </br>
        </br>As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable, or more
        </br>indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were an immediate
        </br>recommendation; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully
        </br>supporting the superficial, that she was at first, as she told Anne,
        </br>almost ready to exclaim, "Can this be Mr Elliot?" and could not
        </br>seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.
        </br>Everything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions,
        </br>knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.  He had strong feelings of
        </br>family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he
        </br>lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he
        </br>judged for himself in everything essential, without defying public
        </br>opinion in any point of worldly decorum.  He was steady, observant,
        </br>moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness,
        </br>which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to
        </br>what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of
        </br>domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent
        </br>agitation seldom really possess.  She was sure that he had not been
        </br>happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;
        </br>but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty
        </br>soon to suspect) to prevent his thinking of a second choice.  Her
        </br>satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.
        </br>
        </br>It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her
        </br>excellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not
        </br>surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing
        </br>suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than
        </br>appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.  In Lady
        </br>Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a mature
        </br>time of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would
        </br>very generally recommend him among all sensible people, to be on good
        </br>terms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world of
        </br>time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of
        </br>youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to
        </br>mention "Elizabeth."  Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only
        </br>this cautious reply:--"Elizabeth! very well; time will explain."
        </br>
        </br>It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little
        </br>observation, felt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at
        </br>present.  In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the
        </br>habit of such general observance as "Miss Elliot," that any
        </br>particularity of attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,
        </br>it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.  A little
        </br>delay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact, Anne could never
        </br>see the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the
        </br>inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though
        </br>his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many
        </br>years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the
        </br>awful impression of its being dissolved.
        </br>
        </br>However it might end, he was without any question their pleasantest
        </br>acquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him; and it was a great
        </br>indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed to
        </br>have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.
        </br>They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many
        </br>times.  He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some
        </br>earnestness.  She knew it well; and she remembered another person's
        </br>look also.
        </br>
        </br>They did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion she
        </br>perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance, it
        </br>must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly into her
        </br>father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy
        </br>to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of
        </br>the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her daughter, the Honourable
        </br>Miss Carteret; and all the comfort of No. --, Camden Place, was swept
        </br>away for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anne's opinion, most
        </br>unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to
        </br>introduce themselves properly.
        </br>
        </br>Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with
        </br>nobility, and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped
        </br>better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and
        </br>was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish that
        </br>they had more pride; for "our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss
        </br>Carteret;" "our cousins, the Dalrymples," sounded in her ears all day
        </br>long.
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but had
        </br>never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the
        </br>case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by
        </br>letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,
        </br>when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's at the same
        </br>time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.  No letter of
        </br>condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect had been visited on
        </br>the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no
        </br>letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there
        </br>was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the
        </br>relationship as closed.  How to have this anxious business set to
        </br>rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question:  and it was
        </br>a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor
        </br>Mr Elliot thought unimportant.  "Family connexions were always worth
        </br>preserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken
        </br>a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in
        </br>style.  She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had
        </br>heard her spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that
        </br>the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any
        </br>compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots."
        </br>
        </br>Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote a
        </br>very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his
        </br>right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could
        </br>admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three
        </br>lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.  "She was very much
        </br>honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance." The toils of the
        </br>business were over, the sweets began.  They visited in Laura Place,
        </br>they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable
        </br>Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible:  and
        </br>"Our cousins in Laura Place,"--"Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss
        </br>Carteret," were talked of to everybody.
        </br>
        </br>Anne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very
        </br>agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they
        </br>created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,
        </br>accomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name
        </br>of "a charming woman," because she had a smile and a civil answer for
        </br>everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so
        </br>awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but
        </br>for her birth.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet "it
        </br>was an acquaintance worth having;" and when Anne ventured to speak her
        </br>opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing in
        </br>themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good
        </br>company, as those who would collect good company around them, they had
        </br>their value.  Anne smiled and said,
        </br>
        </br>"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,
        </br>well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is
        </br>what I call good company."
        </br>
        </br>"You are mistaken," said he gently, "that is not good company; that is
        </br>the best.  Good company requires only birth, education, and manners,
        </br>and with regard to education is not very nice.  Birth and good manners
        </br>are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing
        </br>in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.  My cousin Anne
        </br>shakes her head.  She is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear
        </br>cousin" (sitting down by her), "you have a better right to be
        </br>fastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?
        </br>Will it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society of
        </br>those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the
        </br>connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it, that they will
        </br>move in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your
        </br>being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your
        </br>family (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we
        </br>must all wish for."
        </br>
        </br>"Yes," sighed Anne, "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!"
        </br>then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,
        </br>"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to
        </br>procure the acquaintance.  I suppose" (smiling) "I have more pride than
        </br>any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so
        </br>solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very
        </br>sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them."
        </br>
        </br>"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.  In London,
        </br>perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say:
        </br>but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth
        </br>knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance."
        </br>
        </br>"Well," said Anne, "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome
        </br>which depends so entirely upon place."
        </br>
        </br>"I love your indignation," said he; "it is very natural.  But here you
        </br>are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the
        </br>credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.  You
        </br>talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to
        </br>believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have
        </br>the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little
        </br>different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin," (he continued,
        </br>speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) "in one
        </br>point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that every addition
        </br>to your father's society, among his equals or superiors, may be of use
        </br>in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him."
        </br>
        </br>He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately
        </br>occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant; and
        </br>though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,
        </br>she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience
        </br>admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting great
        </br>acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.
        </br>

        </br>
        </br>Chapter 17
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good
        </br>fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very
        </br>different description.
        </br>
        </br>She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of there
        </br>being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on
        </br>her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,
        </br>now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her
        </br>life when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,
        </br>grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling
        </br>her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of
        </br>strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;
        </br>and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the
        </br>want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at
        </br>school, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably
        </br>lessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.
        </br>
        </br>Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was
        </br>said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had
        </br>known of her, till now that their governess's account brought her
        </br>situation forward in a more decided but very different form.
        </br>
        </br>She was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant; and at his
        </br>death, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfully
        </br>involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and
        </br>in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe
        </br>rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for
        </br>the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath on that account, and was
        </br>now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable
        </br>even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost
        </br>excluded from society.
        </br>
        </br>Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from
        </br>Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in
        </br>going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what she
        </br>intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.  She only
        </br>consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, and
        </br>was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings in
        </br>Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.
        </br>
        </br>The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest
        </br>in each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes had its
        </br>awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone since they had
        </br>parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the
        </br>other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming,
        </br>silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of
        </br>seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as
        </br>consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had
        </br>transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow
        </br>of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless
        </br>widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but all
        </br>that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left
        </br>only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and
        </br>talking over old times.
        </br>
        </br>Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she
        </br>had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be
        </br>cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations of the
        </br>past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of
        </br>the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her
        </br>heart or ruined her spirits.
        </br>
        </br>In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and
        </br>Anne's astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine a more
        </br>cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.  She had been very fond
        </br>of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been used to affluence:
        </br>it was gone.  She had no child to connect her with life and happiness
        </br>again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs,
        </br>no health to make all the rest supportable.  Her accommodations were
        </br>limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no
        </br>possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which
        </br>there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never
        </br>quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.  Yet, in spite
        </br>of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of
        </br>languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.  How
        </br>could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined
        </br>that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.  A
        </br>submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply
        </br>resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of
        </br>mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily
        </br>from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of
        </br>herself, which was from nature alone.  It was the choicest gift of
        </br>Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which,
        </br>by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost
        </br>every other want.
        </br>
        </br>There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly
        </br>failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her
        </br>state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable
        </br>object; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken
        </br>possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and
        </br>suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,
        </br>with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at
        </br>that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.  She
        </br>had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her
        </br>good.  It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be
        </br>in good hands.  She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or
        </br>disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her
        </br>that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her
        </br>ill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister
        </br>of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in
        </br>that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to
        </br>attend her.  "And she," said Mrs Smith, "besides nursing me most
        </br>admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I
        </br>could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great
        </br>amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little
        </br>thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so
        </br>busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
        </br>to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.  She had a
        </br>large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can
        </br>afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.  She always takes
        </br>the right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open, you know, when
        </br>they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the
        </br>blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to
        </br>speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.  Hers is a line
        </br>for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and
        </br>observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to
        </br>thousands of those who having only received 'the best education in the
        </br>world,' know nothing worth attending to.  Call it gossip, if you will,
        </br>but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is
        </br>sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:
        </br>something that makes one know one's species better.  One likes to hear
        </br>what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being
        </br>trifling and silly.  To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I
        </br>assure you, is a treat."
        </br>
        </br>Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, "I can easily
        </br>believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they
        </br>are intelligent may be well worth listening to.  Such varieties of
        </br>human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!  And it is not
        </br>merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it
        </br>occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or
        </br>affecting.  What instances must pass before them of ardent,
        </br>disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,
        </br>patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
        </br>that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of
        </br>volumes."
        </br>
        </br>"Yes," said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, "sometimes it may, though I fear
        </br>its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.  Here and
        </br>there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally
        </br>speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a
        </br>sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity
        </br>and fortitude, that one hears of.  There is so little real friendship
        </br>in the world! and unfortunately" (speaking low and tremulously) "there
        </br>are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late."
        </br>
        </br>Anne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been what he
        </br>ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made
        </br>her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.  It was but a
        </br>passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon
        </br>added in a different tone--
        </br>
        </br>"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,
        </br>will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing
        </br>Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,
        </br>fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report
        </br>but of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,
        </br>however.  She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the
        </br>high-priced things I have in hand now."
        </br>
        </br>Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of
        </br>such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary
        </br>to speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one
        </br>morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple
        </br>for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that
        </br>evening in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.  They
        </br>were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at
        </br>home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had
        </br>been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great
        </br>alacrity--"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old
        </br>schoolfellow."  They were not much interested in anything relative to
        </br>Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it
        </br>understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was
        </br>disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.
        </br>
        </br>"Westgate Buildings!" said he, "and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be
        </br>visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith; and
        </br>who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to
        </br>be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?  That she is old
        </br>and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most
        </br>extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts other people, low
        </br>company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting
        </br>to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow:  she
        </br>is not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another
        </br>day.  What is her age?  Forty?"
        </br>
        </br>"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off
        </br>my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will
        </br>at once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath to-morrow,
        </br>and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged."
        </br>
        </br>"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?" asked
        </br>Elizabeth.
        </br>
        </br>"She sees nothing to blame in it," replied Anne; "on the contrary, she
        </br>approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs
        </br>Smith."
        </br>
        </br>"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
        </br>of a carriage drawn up near its pavement," observed Sir Walter.  "Sir
        </br>Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,
        </br>but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to
        </br>convey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!
        </br>A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs
        </br>Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the
        </br>world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred
        </br>by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and
        </br>Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!"
        </br>
        </br>Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it
        </br>advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did
        </br>long to say a little in defence of her friend's not very dissimilar
        </br>claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father
        </br>prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it to himself to
        </br>recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty
        </br>and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.
        </br>
        </br>Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she
        </br>heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.  She had
        </br>been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had
        </br>not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves, but had
        </br>actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had
        </br>been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr
        </br>Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady
        </br>Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait
        </br>on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could
        </br>supply from Lady Russell.  To her, its greatest interest must be, in
        </br>having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in
        </br>having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for
        </br>staying away in such a cause.  Her kind, compassionate visits to this
        </br>old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr
        </br>Elliot.  He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her
        </br>temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet
        </br>even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be
        </br>given to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be
        </br>so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable
        </br>sensations which her friend meant to create.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.
        </br>She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his
        </br>deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which
        </br>would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and
        </br>leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.  She
        </br>would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the
        </br>subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be
        </br>hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness
        </br>of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.
        </br>Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled,
        </br>blushed, and gently shook her head.
        </br>
        </br>"I am no match-maker, as you well know," said Lady Russell, "being much
        </br>too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.
        </br>I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses
        </br>to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there
        </br>would be every possibility of your being happy together.  A most
        </br>suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be
        </br>a very happy one."
        </br>
        </br>"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I
        </br>think highly of him," said Anne; "but we should not suit."
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, "I own that to
        </br>be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future
        </br>Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's
        </br>place, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well as
        </br>to all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.
        </br>You are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if I
        </br>might be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name,
        </br>and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to
        </br>her in being more highly valued!  My dearest Anne, it would give me
        </br>more delight than is often felt at my time of life!"
        </br>
        </br>Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,
        </br>and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings
        </br>this picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart
        </br>were bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been; of
        </br>having the precious name of "Lady Elliot" first revived in herself; of
        </br>being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again, her home for
        </br>ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.  Lady Russell
        </br>said not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own
        </br>operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with
        </br>propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short, what Anne
        </br>did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself
        </br>brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch and of "Lady
        </br>Elliot" all faded away.  She never could accept him.  And it was not
        </br>only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her
        </br>judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a
        </br>case was against Mr Elliot.
        </br>
        </br>Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied
        </br>that she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man, an
        </br>agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to
        </br>judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough.
        </br>He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one article
        </br>of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have been
        </br>afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past, if not the
        </br>present.  The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the
        </br>allusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not
        </br>favourable of what he had been.  She saw that there had been bad
        </br>habits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had
        </br>been a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had
        </br>been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he might
        </br>now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of
        </br>a clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair
        </br>character?  How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly
        </br>cleansed?
        </br>
        </br>Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.  There
        </br>was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,
        </br>at the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided
        </br>imperfection.  Her early impressions were incurable.  She prized the
        </br>frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.  Warmth
        </br>and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could so
        </br>much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or
        </br>said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind
        </br>never varied, whose tongue never slipped.
        </br>
        </br>Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers in
        </br>her father's house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well, stood
        </br>too well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some degree of
        </br>openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was
        </br>about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him as
        </br>agreeable as any body.
        </br>
        </br>Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend, for she saw
        </br>nothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine a man more exactly
        </br>what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter
        </br>feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved
        </br>Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn.
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Chapter 18
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in
        </br>Bath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.  She
        </br>wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.  It was three
        </br>weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew that Henrietta was at
        </br>home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering fast,
        </br>was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all very intently one
        </br>evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to
        </br>her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs
        </br>Croft's compliments.
        </br>
        </br>The Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.  They were
        </br>people whom her heart turned to very naturally.
        </br>
        </br>"What is this?" cried Sir Walter.  "The Crofts have arrived in Bath?
        </br>The Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?"
        </br>
        </br>"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir."
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an
        </br>introduction.  I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any
        </br>rate.  I know what is due to my tenant."
        </br>
        </br>Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poor
        </br>Admiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.  It had been
        </br>begun several days back.
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>"February 1st.
        </br>
        </br>"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know how
        </br>little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.  You must be a
        </br>great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know,
        </br>affords little to write about.  We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr
        </br>and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.  I do
        </br>not reckon the Hayters as anybody.  The holidays, however, are over at
        </br>last:  I believe no children ever had such long ones.  I am sure I had
        </br>not.  The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles;
        </br>but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.  Mrs
        </br>Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.  I do not
        </br>understand it.  They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but
        </br>Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her
        </br>grandchildren.  What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt
        </br>in Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some
        </br>consequence.  I have not had a creature call on me since the second
        </br>week in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much
        </br>oftener than was welcome.  Between ourselves, I think it a great pity
        </br>Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept
        </br>her a little out of his way.  The carriage is gone to-day, to bring
        </br>Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.  We are not asked to dine with
        </br>them, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her
        </br>being fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering
        </br>the care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more
        </br>convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.  I am glad you find Mr Elliot
        </br>so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I have
        </br>my usual luck:  I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is
        </br>going on; always the last of my family to be noticed.  What an immense
        </br>time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to
        </br>go away?  But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might
        </br>not be invited.  Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect
        </br>my children to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House
        </br>very well, for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the
        </br>Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral
        </br>gouty.  Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the
        </br>civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.  I do
        </br>not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,
        </br>and this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me
        </br>in love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,
        </br>
        </br>"Mary M---.
        </br>
        </br>"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just
        </br>told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much
        </br>about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are
        </br>always worse than anybody's."
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an
        </br>envelope, containing nearly as much more.
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore her
        </br>journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add.
        </br>In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to
        </br>convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to
        </br>me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as
        </br>long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely
        </br>hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.  I shall be truly glad to
        </br>have them back again.  Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant
        </br>family.  But now for Louisa.  I have something to communicate that will
        </br>astonish you not a little.  She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very
        </br>safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were
        </br>rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had
        </br>been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the
        </br>reason?  Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and
        </br>not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr
        </br>Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came
        </br>away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.  True, upon
        </br>my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised at least if
        </br>you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.  Mrs Musgrove protests
        </br>solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.  We are all very well
        </br>pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain
        </br>Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove
        </br>has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.  Mrs
        </br>Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister's
        </br>account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both.  Indeed,
        </br>Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having
        </br>nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if
        </br>you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see
        </br>anything of it.  And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's
        </br>being supposed to be an admirer of yours.  How Charles could take such
        </br>a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me.  I hope he
        </br>will be more agreeable now.  Certainly not a great match for Louisa
        </br>Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters."
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared for
        </br>the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.  Captain
        </br>Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful for belief,
        </br>and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room,
        </br>preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the
        </br>moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter wanted to
        </br>know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they
        </br>were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss
        </br>Elliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond.
        </br>
        </br>"How is Mary?" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, "And
        </br>pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?"
        </br>
        </br>"They come on the Admiral's account.  He is thought to be gouty."
        </br>
        </br>"Gout and decrepitude!" said Sir Walter.  "Poor old gentleman."
        </br>
        </br>"Have they any acquaintance here?" asked Elizabeth.
        </br>
        </br>"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's time
        </br>of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance in
        </br>such a place as this."
        </br>
        </br>"I suspect," said Sir Walter coolly, "that Admiral Croft will be best
        </br>known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.  Elizabeth, may we
        </br>venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?"
        </br>
        </br>"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,
        </br>we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she
        </br>might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify; but
        </br>as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.  We
        </br>had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.  There are several
        </br>odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors.  The
        </br>Crofts will associate with them."
        </br>
        </br>This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;
        </br>when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in an
        </br>enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne was
        </br>at liberty.
        </br>
        </br>In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder
        </br>how Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,
        </br>had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.
        </br>She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin
        </br>to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure that
        </br>such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.
        </br>
        </br>Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited, joyous-talking
        </br>Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain
        </br>Benwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.
        </br>Their minds most dissimilar!  Where could have been the attraction?
        </br>The answer soon presented itself.  It had been in situation.  They had
        </br>been thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same
        </br>small family party:  since Henrietta's coming away, they must have been
        </br>depending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering
        </br>from illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was
        </br>not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne had not been able to
        </br>avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as
        </br>Mary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm
        </br>the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.
        </br>She did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her
        </br>vanity, than Mary might have allowed.  She was persuaded that any
        </br>tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for
        </br>him would have received the same compliment.  He had an affectionate
        </br>heart.  He must love somebody.
        </br>
        </br>She saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine naval
        </br>fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.  He would
        </br>gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott
        </br>and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they
        </br>had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned
        </br>into a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was
        </br>amusing, but she had no doubt of its being so.  The day at Lyme, the
        </br>fall from the Cobb, might influence her health, her nerves, her
        </br>courage, her character to the end of her life, as thoroughly as it
        </br>appeared to have influenced her fate.
        </br>
        </br>The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been
        </br>sensible of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer
        </br>another man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting
        </br>wonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly
        </br>nothing to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart
        </br>beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks when
        </br>she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.  She had some
        </br>feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.  They were too much like
        </br>joy, senseless joy!
        </br>
        </br>She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was
        </br>evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.  The visit of
        </br>ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and
        </br>Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.
        </br>
        </br>The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly
        </br>to Sir Walter's satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed of the
        </br>acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about
        </br>the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.
        </br>
        </br>The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and
        </br>considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,
        </br>and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.  They brought
        </br>with them their country habit of being almost always together.  He was
        </br>ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares
        </br>with him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good.  Anne
        </br>saw them wherever she went.  Lady Russell took her out in her carriage
        </br>almost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and never
        </br>failed to see them.  Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most
        </br>attractive picture of happiness to her.  She always watched them as
        </br>long as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might be
        </br>talking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally
        </br>delighted to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he
        </br>encountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation
        </br>when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft
        </br>looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.
        </br>
        </br>Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking
        </br>herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days
        </br>after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or
        </br>her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone
        </br>to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good
        </br>fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing by himself at a
        </br>printshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation
        </br>of some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but was
        </br>obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his
        </br>notice.  When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was done
        </br>with all his usual frankness and good humour.  "Ha! is it you?  Thank
        </br>you, thank you.  This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you
        </br>see, staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without
        </br>stopping.  But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.
        </br>Did you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must
        </br>be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless
        </br>old cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it
        </br>mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and
        </br>mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they
        </br>certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!" (laughing
        </br>heartily); "I would not venture over a horsepond in it.  Well,"
        </br>(turning away), "now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere for you,
        </br>or with you?  Can I be of any use?"
        </br>
        </br>"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your
        </br>company the little way our road lies together.  I am going home."
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes we will
        </br>have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go
        </br>along.  There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if
        </br>I have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!" taking a last look
        </br>at the picture, as they began to be in motion.
        </br>
        </br>"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?"
        </br>
        </br>"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I
        </br>shall only say, 'How d'ye do?' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.
        </br>'How d'ye do?'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.
        </br>She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her
        </br>heels, as large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the
        </br>street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby
        </br>fellows, both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.
        </br>Sophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once: got away
        </br>with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story another
        </br>time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.  Look, he
        </br>sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.  Ah! the
        </br>peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!  How
        </br>do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.  We are always
        </br>meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every
        </br>morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them
        </br>all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and
        </br>are snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at
        </br>North Yarmouth and Deal.  We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I
        </br>can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North
        </br>Yarmouth.  The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same
        </br>way."
        </br>
        </br>When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for
        </br>what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to
        </br>have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, for
        </br>the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the
        </br>greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really Mrs
        </br>Croft, she must let him have his own way.  As soon as they were fairly
        </br>ascending Belmont, he began--
        </br>
        </br>"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.  But first
        </br>of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk
        </br>about.  That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned
        </br>for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.  Her
        </br>Christian name:  I always forget her Christian name."
        </br>
        </br>Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really
        </br>did; but now she could safely suggest the name of "Louisa."
        </br>
        </br>"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies
        </br>had not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out
        </br>if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well, this Miss
        </br>Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.  He was
        </br>courting her week after week.  The only wonder was, what they could be
        </br>waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear
        </br>enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right.  But even
        </br>then there was something odd in their way of going on.  Instead of
        </br>staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see
        </br>Edward.  When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward's,
        </br>and there he has been ever since.  We have seen nothing of him since
        </br>November.  Even Sophy could not understand it.  But now, the matter has
        </br>taken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss
        </br>Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James
        </br>Benwick.  You know James Benwick."
        </br>
        </br>"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick."
        </br>
        </br>"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,
        </br>for I do not know what they should wait for."
        </br>
        </br>"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man," said Anne, "and
        </br>I understand that he bears an excellent character."
        </br>
        </br>"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.
        </br>He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad
        </br>times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.  An
        </br>excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous
        </br>officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that
        </br>soft sort of manner does not do him justice."
        </br>
        </br>"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of
        </br>spirit from Captain Benwick's manners.  I thought them particularly
        </br>pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please."
        </br>
        </br>"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather
        </br>too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,
        </br>Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his.
        </br>There is something about Frederick more to our taste."
        </br>
        </br>Anne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of
        </br>spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to
        </br>represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best that could
        </br>possibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say,
        </br>"I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends," but the
        </br>Admiral interrupted her with--
        </br>
        </br>"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.  We
        </br>have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter from him
        </br>yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a
        </br>letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.  I fancy
        </br>they are all at Uppercross."
        </br>
        </br>This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said,
        </br>therefore, "I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of
        </br>Captain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly
        </br>uneasy.  It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment
        </br>between him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to
        </br>have worn out on each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his
        </br>letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man."
        </br>
        </br>"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from
        </br>beginning to end."
        </br>
        </br>Anne looked down to hide her smile.
        </br>
        </br>"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much
        </br>spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit
        </br>she should have him."
        </br>
        </br>"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in
        </br>Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks
        </br>himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, without
        </br>its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry that such a
        </br>friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be
        </br>destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort."
        </br>
        </br>"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that
        </br>nature in the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;
        </br>does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for
        </br>wondering at it.'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,
        </br>that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself.
        </br>He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is
